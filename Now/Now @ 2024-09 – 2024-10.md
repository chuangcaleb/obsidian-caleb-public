# Now @ 2024-09 – 2024-10

I started September with a TON of notetaking on ⚖️ rationality — logical fallacies and cognitive biases. It’s become a bit.

> “Gambler’s Fallacy bro, it’s already 1am, stop queuing”

> “We’re getting coins for losing the match, we’re getting Pavlov’ed.”

> “That antecedent is necessary, but insufficient for the consequent”
> “bro what”

> “Recognise the fallacy, while no one’s perfect—”
> “—Except me, of course.”

And 🎂 birthday was great! Uncle bought a cake for me to office, and everyone shared and chatted, that was really nice.

Then mostly throughout October…

I’ve then been watching a lot of community-licensed 🎭 stage musicals, different versions too. Have been singing to myself a lot.

Really meaningful 👥 meetups with longtime friends. City walk, impromptu overnight, insane convos I’d never image I’d have, a cooking stream, and a goodbye.

And I did a bunch of work doing a makeover for the 🪴 [digital garden](/garden)! Now I’m not just listing everything in one long list (yuck)—we’ve got them sorted by collections, baby. And it’s many-to-many, and it’s dynamically handled. Just in time too!
