# Now @ 2024-08

I honestly don’t have too much to share about August, compared to the hectic months before. I am grateful for the un-eventfulness.

Really getting settled into work at decube! Actually contributing. And snacking a lot. A lot. I paid for a MY50 metro season pass this month, the scale of travel is still bad. It does give opportunity to meet people around uptown that I wouldn’t otherwise be close-by to meet up with. And besides travel, everything else about new work has been awesome.

Been playing a lot of video games this month. Gonna make it a point to moderate playtime, as fun as it really is! There. Three paragraphs lol
