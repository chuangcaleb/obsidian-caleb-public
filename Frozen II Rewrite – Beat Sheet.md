# Frozen II Rewrite – Beat Sheet

[Written in Google Docs, currently at 18.6k words, you can find it here!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MZKWkegyyvGFvyRAcahXhfmD-dE4LG-GbGaRsCyl7-s/edit?usp=sharing)

## F2R

The initial project started in 21 Dec 2019, after watching the movie twice in early December.

### Key Points

- Aligned and synergised the climaxes of Elsa’s and Anna’s arcs
	- ~~SPOILERS: Elsa sees Anna in Ahtohallan~~
- Refocused the themes and motifs of the story
- Ensured constant ticking-time bomb and antagonistic force:
	- Antagonism personified by a human, Runeard
- Concrete plot/scene objectives
- Kristoff isn’t a himbo anymore, he contributes way more with his subplot arcs with Anna and Mattias
	- Mattias isn’t a plot device, he contributes more
- Made magic out of plot holes
- Reworked the lore
- Fleshed out objectives and conflict of our two factions in the Forest
- Everyone has personal callbacks to F1 during this quest
- We see new opinions on events of Frozen 1
- Cut down on action screen time for story development

### First Draft

Once the First Draft was complete, I did a screen recording with handpicked soundtracks, scrolling through the sections according to the emotional dynamics of the music. I uploaded this to [wtsa's instagram highlights reel](https://www.instagram.com/whatsthestoryabout/).

### Reflection

It was my first time writing and realising a movie length story, even if an “alternative universe fanfiction”. There were a lot of writing techniques applied and skills developed.

## F2R²

A second rewrite over Spring 2020 where I toyed with the idea of Arendelle getting destroyed by the flood. I also went back to iron out plot holes and tidied up the script.

## F2R Commentary

Adding comments to the Google Docs, giving my commentary on the different plot points and purposeful details, the why and the how. My thought processes.

This was for a reminder for myself, as well as for anyone interested to read.

I stopped at the Campfire Truce scene because IT TAKES SO MUCH TIME but since [[Writing makes an exact man]], it was great to get some of it down on paper!
