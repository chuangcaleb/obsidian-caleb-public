## Overview Disclaimer

- If I were to properly rewrite the story, I'd change names like "Benja" and "Druun". However, to prevent needless confusion, I'll leave the names as they are. Just imagine that the names feel a bit more cultural/mythical!
- Also, I’m solo-writing from a Malaysian context. So without a full team of experts (or just locals, really), it’s going to lack a lot of cultural influences from the other SEA countries. But I think for a rough sketch, it’s enough to get a general picture. The objective is not so much on cultural accuracy (though I’ve added some easy wins), but on the narrative throughline.
