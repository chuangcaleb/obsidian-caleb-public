# RAYA Preface
## Overview Disclaimer

- If I were to properly rewrite the story, I'd change names like "Benja" and "Druun". However, to prevent needless confusion, I'll leave the names as they are. Just imagine that the names feel a bit more cultural/mythical!
- Also, I’m solo-writing from a Malaysian context. So without a full team of experts (or just locals, really), it’s going to lack a lot of cultural influences from the other SEA countries. But I think for a rough sketch, it’s enough to get a general picture. The objective is not so much on cultural accuracy (though I’ve added some easy wins), but on the narrative throughline.

###### End of Preface

# RAYA E1 - Kumandra Divided

> Theme: The Zero-Sum World of Kumandra - Past, Present, Future

## Planning Notes

### Narrative sequence vs chronological sequence

- The X-Men Days of Future Past movie alternates between the characters/plot in the past (1980's) and the dystopian future (2100's), so that one time continuity is actively changing the outcome of the other time continuity — the two continuities are happening in parallel
	- That's one aspect of the non-linear storytelling effect I want to have with this cutting-back-and-forth style in Episode 1
- The present-day Kumandra is so bleak — and in a sense, the past events already happened and caused the fallout
	- We slowly reveal the extent of the fallout according to past events
- And yet, during the scenes set in the past, it's *almost* as if the fallout could've been prevented, especially as present-continuity-Raya exhibits the distrust that saves her in the present, and it would've definitely saved her in the past
	- It’s revealed at one point in the episode that present!Raya's sword was originally her father's, *narratively while* her father was still championing his cooperation ideals (as shown in the past). This causes the audience to wonder — what happened in between?
	- Present!Raya says she was betrayed, narratively sequenced in the episode for the audience, before past-Raya got betrayed
	- It's mentioned in the present that Heart is in ruins, and that’s narratively arranged right before Namaari’s betrayal in the past

### Names

I was quite particular on the consistency of naming. I’m going to stick to the original names where applicable in this rewrite for clarity. Ideally there’s more subtextual language distinctives between tribes.

### Skip the Prologue

- So, let's rework the opening voiceover narration scene. Besides, Raya had no one to explain Kumandra to.
- There are two "backstories" to exposition-dump.
 1. 500 years ago: Dragons defeating the Druun,
 2. "6" years ago: Druun returning with the separated shattered Gem
	- (Let’s dub this, “The Shattering”)
	- btw, retconning this to be 15 years instead of 6 years for the effects of the division to be more ingrained into the new culture
- There's just so much exposition to cover. But I think that the 500 years ago story is not as personal nor action-packed as opening straight away *in media res*.
- “The Shattering” is just much more personal to the main characters, this is our *media res*.
- Kumandra’s 500 years ago, can feed in MUCH later.

## The Story

### Hook: Zero-Sum Kumandra

#### Present—Establish world, protagonist & story goal

![|250](https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/barren-terraced-rice-field-northern-thailand-arid-climate-dry-season-69358738.jpg) ![|250](https://i0.wp.com/project2049.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Asiaeye_southeast-asia-drought_033110.jpg) ![|250](https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/barren-rice-field-cracked-land-thailand-dry-fields-parched-harvest-season-274385599.jpg)![|250](https://javaadventuretrail.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/sunrise-in-mount-bromo.jpg) ![|250](https://images.fineartamerica.com/images/artworkimages/mediumlarge/1/night-over-mount-bromo-java-joana-kruse.jpg)

> **TAIL LANDSCAPE - DAY (PRESENT)**

- Establishing shots of Tail: it's a *southeastern* wasteland. Not a typical American/African desert, but instead we have limestone cliffs, canyons and caves. The terrain is hilly, and the soil is caked, hard from the heat. The sparse and small vegetation all yellow up from dehydration. Small rats and lizards scuttle for cover from the heat of noonday. Many lifelike stone statues.
	- Chyron: **TAIL - CURRENT DAY**
- We have a masked lone adult rider, on an animal mount. Very quickly, let's change Tuk-Tuk to be some panda-pangolin hybrid. A *Pandolin*.
- She holds up a Map. X-marks litter the landscape. The camera focuses on a drawing of the complete Dragon Gem, circled and in the center of drawn pointed arrows.
	- This woman really wants this Gem.

#### Past—Like Father, Like Daughter

> **DRIPPING CARVED-OUT TUNNEL PASSAGEWAY, HEART - NIGHT (PAST)**

- Chyron: **HEART - FIFTEEN YEARS EARLIER**
- It's bright and colourful, in contrast to the pale and lifeless Tail.
- We introduce young Raya, in full stealth/combat gear. She also has a drawing of the mythical Dragon Gem, annotated with arrows in the same handwriting.
- In a tunnel of sorts, she bypasses traps by identifying and working around rigged false-hopes and paths — with the help of her then-smaller mount, Tuk-Tuk.

> **CHAMBER OF THE DRAGON GEM, HEART**

![cave](https://images.ctfassets.net/dqbqab5lm2pa/3ZEBefGaBwCHMDNyWJNnOW/72d8ac14be64a9df914ecea66570b530/Concept_Art_of_Raya_and_The_Last_Dragon_-_65.jpg?w=1000&q=75)

- She enters the Chamber of the Dragon Gem, guarded by a silhouetted guardian.
	- There is a glowing blue Gem on a pedestal in the center of the room, the same one as earlier pictured in the Map in the first scene in the present-day.
	- The guardian calls Raya by name (establishing her name to the audience), and announces that he won't let her step one foot into the inner circle platform where the Gem is.
	- The guardian never has to unsheathe his sword — we're saving epic reveal for later.
- They fight it out
	- Raya addresses the guardian as "Chief Benja" of the Heart tribe
- Chief Benja would taunt Raya by saying aloud his moves ahead of time. Raya says she doesn't trust him, moving in contrary. But Chief Benja always tells the truth, which causes Raya to fail her blocks and attacks.
- Ultimately, Benja disarms her. However, Raya had actually won: she had one toe on the inner circle platform.
	- Chief Benja congratulates his daughter, revealing to the audience that he is her father who is training her.
- Benja awards Raya's success by promoting her to Guardian of the Dragon Gem, as her ancestors before her.
- This original sequence was quite fun, especially the reveal that the masked guardian is her father, and then that Raya beats him and gets promoted. No critique here.

```screenplay
YOUNG RAYA
Anyone hoping to steal the dragon gem now has to face the fury of the TWO baddest blades in all the lands.

BENJA
I'm glad you feel prepared, dewdrop, because the other lands... they're on their way here as we speak.

YOUNG RAYA
They are?! Right NOW?!

BENJA
Yes. And we must prepare to meet them.
```

- We end the scene ambiguously there, as if the other lands are about to lay siege just as they finished their training. And jump straight to:

#### Present—”X” Marks the Spot

> **TAIL LANDSCAPE - DUSK (PRESENT)**

- It's approaching sundown.
- The rider sees a purple energy glow just behind a nearby hill. She quickly veers in the opposite direction.
- The rider then spots a small camp of wasteland nomads.
	- The camp is built on top of a small, pitiful water stream.
- The rider pulls down her face mask, and it's obviously adult-Raya!
- Raya glances at her map. She points at her current location via a nearby landmark, and finds that the camp's location is over a circled river that is not checked off yet.
- The rider dismounts, slouching bent-over and dragging her steps, her mount the same.
- She approaches the camp, but a few figures notice her, and run out towards her.
	- She checks her sidearm — yes, Chief Benja's whip-sword is there and ready.

### A Kumandra Feast

#### Past—Benja's One-Kumandra Dream

> **PALACE KITCHEN, HEART - DAY (PAST)**

- With Benja's trailing sentence, "We must prepare to meet them. Are you ready to face the other lands”…
- Young-Raya introduces the lands, with flashcard-style overlays for each
	- "We're from the tribe of Heart. Our rainforest rains all the time, which makes us the best for defending the Dragon Gem against the Druun."
	- "The tribe of Tail. A vast expanse of limestone islands, made up of a wide network of villages of skilled navigators and infiltrators."
	- "Then, Talon. A floating market famous for fast deals and fighters, with even faster hands."
	- "Next, Spine. A frigid, bamboo mountain guarded by exceptionally fierce warriors and impenetrable fortress."
	- "Finally, Fang, our most cunning enemy. An advanced city of scholars and builders, making their assassins frighteningly intelligent and sneaky."
- Raya, "And we're going to use our secret weapon to defeat them, once-and-for-all, right?"
	- "That's right, dewdrop." Benja turns to a table as he constructs a stew: "Shrimp paste from Tail, palm sugar from Talon, bamboo shoots from Spine, chilis from Fang, and lemongrass from Heart… my secret weapon is a Kumandra feast."

![stew](https://y.yarn.co/3267eba7-2199-4749-b8a8-6cc15f27724a_screenshot.jpg)

- Raya is perplexed?? "Are we poisoning them?"
	- "No tribe can survive alone anymore. This is the first step to unite the five lands in the line of ten chiefs, since The Great Division."
- "But dad, what about all my training to become Guardian of the Dragon Gem? Who are we guarding against? Not the Druun, since they’ve been gone for centuries."
	- Benja: "While we want to do the right thing, we can't be sure that the other tribes might try something selfish. They think the Gem magically grants us prosperity."
- "That's ridiculous. It doesn't do that… does it?"
	- "They assume it does, just like we assume things about them. (offers a bowl of soup) Raya, there’s a reason why each land is named after a part of the dragon. We were once unified harmoniously as one. Kumandra."
- "That's ancient history, bà."
	- "But it doesn’t have to be. Listen, if we don’t stop and learn to trust one another again, it’s only a matter of time before we tear each other apart *before the actual Druun monsters do*. This isn’t the world I want you to live in."
- Raya nods.
	- Benja: "I believe that we can be One Kumandra again. Even if I have my second baddest blade in the land to offer a bit of wise precaution… someone has to take the first step. Trust me."

#### Present—A Suspicious Deal

> **NOMAD CAMP OUTSKIRTS, TAIL - NIGHT (PRESENT)**

- Three people from the camp arrive to meet Raya
	- They are armed with a spear and shield
	- They are in a poised stance, wary of this stranger and her huge mount
	- These are the Tail nomads.
- "State your business!" the middle one exclaims. She's holding a lantern; it's getting dark.
	- Raya: "*S’lam*. I am Rahmidah, daughter of Hazim, tribe of Tail. We fled here after my village was destroyed by the Druun… I know we don't trust each other, but I just need to set up camp for the night."
	- The nomad is suspicious. "I've never heard of the family name 'Hazim'. Besides, you're at the far end of Tail, why aren't you heading towards the other tribes? Fang has their intricate aqueducts, Spine has their mighty fortress, Talon has their busy floating market. You'd be better off even in Heart than here in this dried-up forsaken land of Tail."
	- Raya, persuasive, "Tail is supposed to be the one tribe that help their own tribe people."
	- "Our own brother stole all our family wealth, and ran away to Talon. You talk about One-Kumandra? Hah!"
- Raya: "I will set up camp there by that rock. It's 200 cubits away from your camp."
	- "You are too close to our river. We don't trust you. Leave us, or we will attack."
- "I will fight to make camp. But let's both agree that fighting would cost us both resources that we don't have. I don't even want to camp so close to you. I don't trust you either. So I'll be gone in the morning. Take these lemongrass herbs as a gift of peace. Or rather, a gift of non-aggression."
	- They whisper amongst themselves, "Lemongrass! They're so rare since Heart…"
- The nomads warily take the lemongrass and back off, returning to their own camp, still on edge. "Don't come near us, we won't come near you."

#### Past—Cultural Exchange

> **BRIDGE, HEART - DAY (PAST)**

![](https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Raya-and-the-Last-Dragon-Five-Regions.jpg)

- Benja and Raya stand on the end of the main bridge leading into Heart. Four distinct factions stand arranged before them. Benja welcomes them.
	- Tail Chief: Nice speech, Chief Benja, but why’d you really bring us here? Are you gonna rob us?
	- Spine Chief: Why would he need to rob us? The land of Heart already has everything.
	- Dang Hai (Talon Chief): *And what is there to rob? Even our rivers are drying up!* (remember this)
	- Virana (Fang chief): It’s easy to champion "Kumandra" when you hold the mightiest weapon in all the lands.
	- Everyone argues.
- Raya steps forward towards the only other kid in the rowdy pack
	- The kid steps forward from behind a woman. "*S’lam*. I'm Namaari. Daughter of the chieftess of Fang."
	- They quickly fangirl together and connect over Naamari's dragon pendant.
	- "Do you want to come eat my dad's Kumandra stew?"
	- They go in together
	- The adults see this, lower their defences, and the chiefs decide to cross over too.

> **PALACE COURTROOM, HEART - DUSK**

- Later in the palace courtroom: it's crowded but no one is mixing around.
- On Young Raya and Namaari:
	- they chatter about their shared princess-ship.
	- Namaari takes a huge bite of the stew: she groans in delight
	- we see a bit of Naamari's Fang-natural intelligence and sharpness
	- Naamari admits this is her first time having such a stew with so many different ingredients. Raya says she has this every day.
		- Namaari explains that while Heart still trades with other tribes, but the other tribes don't really mix around
		- It's not just stew: it's the technology, the architecture, the knowledge. Just look at Tail, they're still fishing to barely survive.
		- Raya exclaims! "That's why Heart seems so prosperous compared to the other tribes: it's not that the Gem gives some magic favour to Heart, but it's that Heart trusts the other tribes."
- Namaari then brings up they're both Sisu fans
	- Naamari: You know, Fang legend says she’s still out there. I'm not supposed to show you this, but…
	- Naamari pulls out a Scroll that she says she's not supposed to show
	- (It's the same scroll that adult Raya is using as her Map!)

#### Past—Before and After

> **NARRATED OVER STYLISTIC PUPPETRY**

- Namaari is the one to retell the legend, much later in the story (but not earlier than it needs to), as it comes to life stylistically in Southeast Asian-inspired puppetry:
	- Kumandra used to be lush when humans lived harmoniously alongside dragons - magical creatures who brought us water and rain and peace.
	- Then, the Druun monsters attacked: multiplying as they consumed life and turned everyone they ~~touched~~ defeated into stone.
	- The dragons fought for us but lost.
	- Finally, 500 years ago, the mighty Sisudatu, the last dragon, concentrated all her magic into a gem and defeated the Druun.
		- Everyone that was turned to stone came back… except the dragons.
		- All that was left of Sisu was her gem.
	- Instead of uniting humanity, people fought to possess the last of dragon magic.
	- Borders were drawn. Kumandra divided. We all became enemies.
	- The Gem was secured by Heart for the past 350 years, and they prospered.

> **PALACE COURTROOM, HEART**

- Namaari expresses, "Though the Druun are no more, yet all Kumandra isn't sharing the Gem like it was way before. It's paradise for Heart, but not for us other tribes. Not that the Gem is magical, but sharing the Gem together is the first step in being united in recognition of what Sisu has done, equally for every person in every tribe. That's what Sisu would have wanted."
- Raya points out on the scroll, that Sisu sleeps dormant at a river's end.
	- Naamari says, if they could ever track down every river, they could bring back Sisu, and reunite Kumandra.
	- Raya looks at her dad, who’s juggling conversations from different tribes. Yes, this is what he’d want, no permission needed.
- Namaari offers Raya her dragon pendant necklace.
	- It's from a part of Naamari's mother's (chieftess) trishula-sceptre.
- Raya says, "One day, we'll track down Sisu together. But I know what we can do today. Follow me."

### When the Chips Fall…

#### Present—Double-Crossed

> **RAYA'S CAMP, TAIL - NIGHT (PRESENT)**

- Raya leaves Tuk-tuk and her supplies back in her own camp, and stealthily creeps towards the outskirts of the nomad camp

> **NOMAD CAMP, TAIL**

- She expects watchmen at every corner — none. She easily slips through their camp.

> **CAVERN, NOMAD CAMP, TAIL**

- She slips into a cavern where the stream ends
- She doesn't waste any time. She does a whole ritual.
	- "Sisudatu… I don’t know if you’re listening. I’m searching every river to find you. I really need your help. I made a mistake. I trusted someone I shouldn’t have."
	- Raya sits. And waits. And waits. Nothing happens. It's a bust.
- "So did I." The nomad leader appears behind her. "Your name is Raya."
	- The other nomads hold up Raya's supplies, and have Tuk-tuk guarded at spear-point. They had raided Raya's camp.
	- The nomad leader continues, "Daughter of Benja. Tribe of Heart. Or what's left of it."
	- *ominous music oooooooo~*

#### Past—Secrets Revealed

> **CHAMBER OF THE DRAGON GEM, HEART - NIGHT (PAST)**

- Young Raya and Naamari enter the Chamber of the Dragon Gem.
- Namaari is awed. "Thank you for sharing the Gem with me."
	- "It's what Sisu would have wanted."
- Suddenly, Naamari slashes a branch at Raya.
	- Raya dodges, but the branch tears a wound into her bare calf.
	- Naamari smirks, "Padipepper brambles. Makes your muscles sleepy. 100% organic Fang produce."
- Raya limps. "What are you doing?"
	- "I'm doing what's right for Fang."
- They take out their weapons and fight viciously.
- Raya does get the upper hand, even with her growing cripple, and knocks Naamari tumbling backwards.
- Naamari just smirks and shoots a whistling firework through the ceiling opening.

> **PALACE COURTYARD, HEART**

- At the palace, Benja is diplomat-ing with Virana.
	- "Chieftess Virana! I hope our daughters' newfound friendship will foster a special bond between Heart and Fang."
- Through a window, the firework explodes and illuminates the night sky.
	- A line of torches head into the mountain of the Chamber.
- Benja turns back, and Virana slips out. The other tribes start to catch on.

#### Present—Premeditation

> **CAVERN, NOMAD CAMP, TAIL - NIGHT (PRESENT)**

- Raya: "You already planned to raid my camp while I was asleep."
	- Nomad: "And you already planned to sneak into our precious river."
- "You wouldn't have let me near your river stream. But I've done no harm, so I will leave your family alone and be on my way."
	- The nomad leader blocks her with a spear.
	- "Not so fast. You think we'll just let you go? You lied to us. We're taking your coins, and your animal mount…"
	- Another nomad interrupts: "And her father's chain-whip-sword-weapon-thing! It's so epic!"
	- The leader, "…and your Dragon Gem shard, please. And *then* you'll be on your way. You can take back your lemongrass too, it tastes nothing like they said."
- Raya: "But you've never seen lemongrass before, you wouldn’t be able to tell if it were actually padipepper?"
	- The nomads start to droop their limbs. Raya smirks.
	- One by one, they all collapse. They mumble, “You *binturi*…”
- A small crack forms in the ground…

### …then the Monsters Rise

#### Past—The Shattering

> **CHAMBER OF THE DRAGON GEM, HEART - NIGHT (PAST)**

- Young Raya and Namaari continue fighting, but Fang soldiers enter the room.
	- Raya backs up against the inner circle platform, ready to fight to the death with her newfound anger.
- SWOOSH! Benja repels into the room, disabling a dozen different adversaries in a short fight sequence.
	- His sword turns into a cool grappling whip which he uses to drive everyone back.
	- This is the same whip-sword that adult Raya has.
	- "You will not set foot on the Dragon Gem’s inner circle." WHOAOAAAA
- The soldiers of the other tribes file into the room, in awe of the Gem.
	- "Fang's making a play for the Gem!"
	- "We should take it for Spine, now!"
	- Everyone readies their weapons.
	- Benja readies too, but sees young Raya in the reflection of his sword…
- Benja announces, "We have a choice. We can tear each other apart, or we can come together and build a better world. It’s not too late. I still believe we can be One-Kumandra again."
- Benja sheathes his sword. “Shall we return to dinner?”
	- Tension fills the air. Eyes dart around, who's making the first move?
- A ~~crossbow~~ blowpipe steadies for Benja’s heart. FWIP!
	- He deflects the dart — it lands in his leg. He crumples.
	- "BÀ!" Raya cries.
	- Everyone rushes past them into the Circle.
- Hands grope at the Gem, until…
	- The Gem shatters against the ground, breaking into five shards.
	- BOOM! The ground shakes, the water in the chamber recedes, the floor opens up.
	- From the broken cracked Earth, a purple evil Druun monster emerges.
	- Benja: "Druun…"
- A soldier rushes in towards the Druun, slashing at it:
	- the blade makes but a small wound in the semi-permeable creature
- The Druun engulfs the soldier
	- turning him into stone
	- and mitosis-duplicating
- It takes 3-4 more tough warriors to fell the original Druun,
	- but by then, they all turned to stone, and add 3-4 more Druun
- A Druun rushes towards Benja and Raya
	- Benja rushes towards a Gem shard and holds it up
	- it repels the Druun
	- “There’s still magic in them!”
	- A mad scramble ensues as each tribe is snatches up a Gem shard for themselves
- A Druun pursues, but is recoiled by a water stream
	- Benja shouts: "Everyone to the river!"
- In the cave, the waterfalls start to dry up…

#### Present—The Echoing

> **CAVERN, NOMAD CAMP, TAIL - NIGHT (PRESENT)**

- Raya collects her items back from each disabled nomad, packing them and readying to leave. "You'll be back to normal by sunrise. Sorry for the… inconvenience."
	- The nomads try to chase after her, but they are lethargic, zombie-like.

> **NOMAD CAMP, TAIL**

- She exits the cavern and climbs up onto Tuk-tuk, surveying the map…
- Suddenly, a purple tendril breaks out from the ground and wraps around her foot. A Druun.
- Raya swings her whip-sword, the blade now glowing and infused with Heart's Gem shard. It effortlessly tears through the Druun, compared to the ineffective simple weapons before.
- She fights a few more, easily with the Gem-fused weapon.
	- Tuk-Tuk kicks some butt too — he’s a steady tank.
- There are some purple glows that come out from the cavern: glows that meant people were being petrified.

#### Past—The Heartbreaking

> **BRIDGE, HEART - NIGHT (PAST)**

- Heart is plunged into chaos
- People flee out of the city via the main bridge
- Benja is very injured
	- The road ahead is too far
	- The bridge shakes and partially crumbles
	- A Druun approaches
- Benja hands his Gem shard to Raya. "Raya, don’t give up on them. Make things right for Heart. I love you, my dewdrop."
- Benja throws Raya off the bridge into the water with his Gem shard and whip-sword
	- A Druun passes through Benja, turning him to stone
	- A current carries young screaming Raya away to safety…

#### Present—Just Another Tuesday

> **NOMAD CAMP, TAIL - DAWN (PRESENT)**

- The Druun retreat from Raya, back into the ground.
- Raya rushes back into the cavern: everyone's turned to stone.
	- But Raya just expressionlessly surveys the carnage — compared to her furious flurry in the scene before.
	- She takes a moment, then comes out
- She raids the ghost-town camp, gets up, and gets on her way.
- Business as usual. She crosses out a spot on the map, then looks up towards the next.

#### Present—Epilogue

> **NOMAD CAMP, TAIL - DAY (PRESENT)**

- A woman on a Serlot (some large tiger-wolf hybrid, like ATV’s) dismounts and enters the cavern.
	- She inspects the carnage left behind by the Druun
	- She picks up the Padipepper from the ground.
	- Some more armour-clad warriors on Serlots step out behind her.
	- We see her face. It’s familiar, but a scar stretches across it.
	- Off-screen: "What are your orders, Princess Namaari?"


# RAYA E2 - Sisu Together

## (Outdated) Planning Notes

- In adding depth to Sisu's characterization, I'd like for her to use weird old-timey terms and a foreign language to describe things and places. Kind of like ATLA's Aang saying "flameo hotman"! Which is way better than Sisu spouting Gen Z slang.
- introducing three major characters in one episode might be rushed. may be better to push introducing Boun into Episode 2B, and focus first on Sisu and Namari. Here’s some things we can add to Episode 2A:
	- Raya and Sisu travelling through the Tail wasteland to the Temple
		- Sisu fighting and being the natural predator of Druun
		- maybe stumbling across the ruined campsite from Episode 1
		- a proper episode for fleshing out Tail, because Episode 1 only shows one bit. So exploring more of Tail culture/locals, why the local geography makes them navigators, why the islands all dried up, how the ex-chieftess messed things up and their shard became lost
	- we could also explore Namaari
		- think like the Zuko scenes in ATLA’s earlier episodes. Quickly establishing her story
		- her vastly improved in combat, against Druun and enemy humans
		- and if there’s episode screentime to show her life after the Shattering
			- her mom commenting on her betrayal of Raya and the messy aftermath (positively? negatively?)
		- 12-years old Namaari, still naive, expresses conflict over her actions, that caused so much destruction and distrust
			- was she just tricking Raya, or does she really believe in the hope of Sisu?
			- and has that belief/hope changed since?
		- we can show Fang’s gem embedded into Fang’s sceptre
		- could also fit an action sequence, 9-years-after-Shattering.
		- Fang goes into lockdown. There’s enemies within walls, some elite spectre-ninja squad causing city-wide havoc.
		- Chieftess Virana sends Namaari to lead the policing.
		- Namaari finds Raya, for the first time since the Shattering, both now 21yo, both alone.
		- Raya, a terrifying one-woman-army, seems to have come for Fang’s Gem shard.
		- they fight it out—Namaari with the combat edge, but Raya with the cheating
		- Namaari manages to protect the Shard. But Raya shrugs, because she got her objective: Namaari’s Scroll/Map to find Sisu
		- They bitterly reminisce, they were so starry-eyed about Sisu. Raya still carries Namaari’s pendant “gift”
		- Namaari (pretends?) cynicism of Raya’s pursuit of Sisu
		- Namaari’s been kept safe within Fang for 9 years, indoctrinated in self-sufficiency. Raya spits, half the population, from every tribe, is now stone.
		- they clash. Raya wins, leaving Namaari with a face wound that would scar. Raya flees the city.
		- Namaari’s furious. Swears her revenge aloud to Raya. She returns Fang’s Shard safely to her mom.
		- in story notes for myself: Namaari’s not seen the outside world since the Shattering. It’s only after this, she checks it out and finds that Raya’s truthful.
	- Episode 2A would end with Raya and Sisu finding Tail’s Gem shard, and Namaari revealing herself.
	- Episode 2B would start with Namaari’s sympathetic “I’m sorry”. So 2A itself doubles down on her ruthless throughout (as Raya narrates), but 2B would offer a puzzling melancholy Namaari (now that Sisu herself has met Namaari)

## The Story

### Hook—Raya’s Scroll

> **WILDERNESS, TAIL - DAY (PRESENT)**

- Chyron: TAIL - ONE WEEK LATER
- We’re in Tail
- Raya and Tuk-Tuk follow a river, which has now shrunk to a pitiful stream. It flows into an old wrecked ship, surrounded by old whale bones, trash, etc.
- POV: Raya sighs tiredly, focusing on her Map Scroll
	- she points to the last un-crossed-out circle
	- she unrolls the Scroll more—there’s some ancient writings, and a drawing of the ritual that she did to try to summon Sisu in Episode 1
	- unrolls it a little more—it’s stamped with: the official Fang insignia.

### Fang

#### The Attack and the Plan

> **MAIN GATES, OUTER WALLS, FANG - NIGHT (PAST)**

- Chyron:
	- FANG (large title)
	- NINE YEARS AFTER THE SHATTERING (smaller subtitle)
	- SIX YEARS AGO (this one replaces the previous)
- Set before a nearby waterfall, an intricately-designed city with ambitious scaffolding, surrounded by a simple stone wall and a water moat.
- ~~BANG! Iron gates crash down shut. A wheel is spun to lock it in place. not much walls, they have water aqueduct things~~
- Soldiers, illuminated by torches, pace up and down the battlements. Commanding shouts are heard, closeby and far away.
- In the distance, a tower bursts into flames. Purple glows. In the foreground, a captain dispatches some troops towards it.

> **NORTH TOWER, OUTER WALLS, FANG**

- A Druun mightily leaps up onto the damaged 10ft walls.
- A team of soldiers bravely takes it down—but a few were defeated in the process, spawning one more Druun each.
- A soldier is backed up against the wall—a Druun slinkers closer.
- A FLASH of blue! FWIP! The Druun cries out and vaporises.
	- It’s 21-years-old Namaari!
	- wielding mother’s Sceptre, but it’s now glowing blue, empowered with a Gem shard (just like Raya’s *keris* whip-sword from Episode 1)
	- she effortlessly clears all the other Druun in sight. Silence.
	- she sees the petrified soldiers, then growls.
- “Reinforcements are coming. What happened?”
- The sole soldier: “Our water moat dried up, then Druun arrived.”
	- Namaari: “How can this be?”
	- “Our water aqueducts were sabotaged. Communication…”

> FADE TO

> **ROYAL COURT, PALACE, FANG - CONTINUOUS**

- Namaari relays the soldier’s message to a court of frenzied generals, their voices cross-faded:
	- “…sabotaged. Communication, supplies, all cut. I’m also getting different reports of water disruptions, in almost every city sector. The city is in lockdown.”
- The Generals panic:
	- “This is too intelligent for the Druun—it must be an attack from another tribe!”
	- “There must be a squad of at least thirty elite *akyaar*!”
- Chieftess Viraana, on the chief seat, points across the table—“Namaari?”
	- Namaari, analytically pondering: “It has to be Tail. The Chieftess of Tail has been missing for two months, along with their Gem shard. They must be trying to steal our shard now that they’ve lost theirs. Besides, they are skilled infiltrators, they know how to strike our weak spots.”
	- Viraana beams proudly. “My daughter, the sharpest among all Fang.”
- Viraana to everyone: “Restore the water pipes to keep out the Druun. But secure the entrypoints between every city sector—these Tail infiltrators are the real enemy.”
	- The Generals salute, and file out.
- Now alone, Viraana turns to Namaari with the glowing Sceptre:
	- “We can hold off the Druun without bringing the Sceptre to the frontlines. That’s where the enemies expect to steal it.”
	- “Correct… Take the Sceptre to the secret vault. Nobody can know, not even the other Generals.”
	- Namaari is given the Sceptre. “Other Generals?”
	- Viranna: “I’m proud of you. My new Chief Military General.”
		- She puts an military armband around Namaari.
		- Namaari softens… then straight-faces and tightens her grip. Nods.

#### An Unknown Assailant

> **ROAD, RESIDENTIAL SECTOR, FANG**

- Namaari confidently strides through a guard checkpoint.
	- She’s wrapped the Sceptre in black cloth and tied with cords, concealing it
- The young guards salute her. The leader of the guards initially doesn’t, but he notices the new armband, and salutes her too.
- In the background, a shadowed silhouette follows from the rooftops.

> **CLEARING, WATERFALL CLIFF, FANG**

- Namaari enters a clearing, besides the top of the waterfall cliff.
- There’s an odd-shaped mound. She pulls away a camouflage cloth—revealing a metal vault.
- She unlocks and opens it. Tosses the cloth-wrapped Sceptre inside the vault.
- Namaari quickly ducks. A sword swings past, and misses her neck.
- Namaari unsheathes her own dual blades, and narrowly parries a flash of deadly blows.
- Namaari kicks out, sending a figure staggering back. They standoff.
	- A lone assailant, masked in full stealth.
	- Namaari herself is poised, dual-blades
- Namaari scans the area. “It’s just you. You took on my entire city by yourself. Who are you?”
	- The assailant, silent, charges Namaari with heavy strikes and tough grunts.
- Namaari rolls backwards and produces a whistling firework rocket, like in previous episode, preparing to launch it into the sky.
	- The assailant speaks. A female voice taunts: “Wouldn’t want mámá to think that her Chief Military General couldn’t handle me on her own?”
	- Namaari locks eyes. Lowers the firework, and tosses it over the cliff’s edge. Picks up her blades.
- They fight some more.
- Namaari disarms the assailant’s blade.
	- But the assailant unsheathes a new blade.
	- In slow motion, Namaari readies to dodge it
	- The new blade comes out. It’s glowing bright blue. The blade seems to curl and extend, longer than expected.
	- Namaari, caught off-guard, leaps backwards. She slips at the edge of the waterfall cliff.
		- She quickly catches the top rock, and starts pulling herself up.
	- The assailant runs into the vault.

#### Success: Sceptre & Scroll

- Namaari pulls herself up to see the assailant stepping out of the vault, victorious with the cloth-wrapped Sceptre.
	- Namaari jeers: “Raya. You’re not a stone statue.”
- Raya sheathes the glowing Whip-Sword. She pulls down her face mask.
	- “My people are stone. My Bábá is stone because of you. Because I trusted you.”
- Raya unfurls the cloth-wrapped Sceptre, revealing—it’s a fake sceptre replica, not glowing at all.
	- Namaari proudly cackles. “The real Sceptre never left the palace.”
	- Raya: “You’re still the same sly *binturi*.”
- Namaari laughs: “There’s no ‘secret vault’—this is where we bury our junk.”
- Raya twirls a Scroll in her hands. “Actually, I got what I came for.”
	- Namaari sneers. “Sisu’s Scroll? And the legend? You should’ve just asked for it! Keep it!”
	- Raya stashes the Scroll into a fantasy Kumandra pitcher-plant, which acts like her (waterproof) satchel.
	- Namaari: “You *really* bought into all that trash.”
	- Raya reveals she’s still wearing the same Dragon Pendant necklace that Namaari gave in Episode 1.
	- Raya: “You’re a back-stabbing traitor. But I know you bought into it too.”
- Namaari scoffs: “You’re going to track down *every* river’s end? Every last one? There must be hundreds. Thousands. Just to find that it was all made up.”
	- Raya: “I actually believed we would have done all that, searched thousands of rivers for Sisu, *TOGETHER*, *the two of us*. Even if we would find out it *WAS* all made up—we could have been the first step towards One-Kumandra.”
	- Namaari: “You’d be a child to believe everything.”
	- Raya: “I was. Never again.”
	- (Note: “Sisu Together” is the title of the episode)
- They clash again.
	- Namaari pulls out padipepper brambles (again), swiping at Raya’s legs—
	- but the thorns shatter—Raya had worn leg greaves protection this time.
	- With Namaari’s momentary surprise, Raya slashes at her with the Whip-Sword—
	- It cuts across Namaari’s face. She screams.
- Namaari blindly charges at Raya
	- Backed up against the cliff, Raya dives off the waterfall, into the basin below
- Namaari halts, and watches Raya disappear into the foam
	- ~~While shaking with fury, she fires the firework rocket in the air. Boom! (decided to have her throw away the rocket earlier, more dramatic)~~
	- She stands over the waterfall.
	- “I SWEAR I’LL GET YOU, RAYA!”
	- We hold this tense moment for a few beats…

### Hello, Sisu

#### The Dragon in the Cavern

> **SHIPWRECK CAVERN, TAIL - DAY (PRESENT)**

- Chyron: TAIL—PRESENT DAY (SIX YEARS LATER)
- It’s an old wrecked ship, surrounded by old whale bones, trash, etc.
- Raya methodically prepares the ritual, and postrates:
- "Sisudatu… I don’t know if you’re listening. For the past six years, I’ve searched every river in Kumandra to find you. And now I’m here at the very last one. I trusted too much, and I broke the world… Sisu, I just really… really want my *bà* back. Please."
- Nothing happens.
	- Raya mumbles, “Even if it were all made up…”
	- She begins to pack up…
- Then magic happens, Sisu majestically appears!
	- “WAHOOOO!!!”
	- She
- Raya breaks down in joy, disbelief, wonder, celebration.
	- “You’re real! It’s all real… My bá….”
- “Where’s everyone?”
	- It’s just me. Everyone else forgot about you.
- We skip the part about unique individual dragon magic abilities. It's meh and doesn't really add much.
- Raya pitches: the Scroll says a fully reassembled Gem will destroy the Druun, just like the first time, and bring everyone back from stone
	- But while the other Gem shards are with the tribe chiefs, Tail’s shard has been lost with the Tail chieftess, for the last six years
- Sisu confirms that she is drawn to the Gem shards and can direct Raya to each shard

#### Naamari Pinch

> **HILLTOP, TAIL**

- (Adult 27yo) Naamari stands on a hilltop
	- we see her face for the first time: a huge scar cuts right across
- She inspects the footprints of Tuk-tuk. Her own Serlot sniffs the tracks. Four Fang soldiers on their own Serlots flank her.
- One of them point out that:
 1. Tail is infested with Druun, Raya's good as stone
 2. Retrieving the scroll isn't worth the risk
- Namaari turns to him, sharply spitting, "Then go back home." The soldiers side-eye amongst themselves.
- Namaari hops onto her mount, "Or, follow me and make things right for Fang."
	- Namaari pushes her mount onwards, leaving the rest of them to continue on.


# RAYA E3 - Tail Behind

## Planning Notes

- 2024-08-09 just got the idea to rename Boun’s ship as “the Steamboat”. It’s such an apt and cultural name. I don’t think steamboats are of this time period, maybe it’s some dystopian prototype, just say it’s magic lol. And he’s gonna champion [steamboat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_pot#Southeast_Asia) (hotpot – dish whereby a heat source placed on the dining table keeps a pot of soup stock simmering)!

## The Story

### Setup Sisu and Namaari

#### Introduce Sisu

> **SHIPWRECK CAVERN, TAIL - DAY (PRESENT)**

- Chyron: TAIL - ONE WEEK LATER
- Raya and Tuk-Tuk follow a river, which has now gone down to a small trickle. It flows into an old wrecked ship, surrounded by old whale bones, trash, etc.
- She enters inside the shipwreck
- She repeats the ritual.
	- "Sisudatu… I don’t know if you’re listening. I’ve searched every river to find you. And now I’m here at the very last one. I trusted too much, and I broke the world… Sisudatu, I just really… really want my *bà* back. Please."
- Magic happens, Sisu appears!
- Raya: “I need to catch you up on a few things…” CUT transition;
- "What?! This is bad. I’ve been asleep for 500 years, you brought back the Druun, and none of my brothers and sisters came back? Why didn’t they come back?" #todo
- Let's skip the part about unique individual dragon magic abilities. It's meh and doesn't really add much.
- Raya pitches: the scroll says a fully reassembled Gem will destroy the Druun, just like the first time, and bring everyone back from stone
	- But while the other Gem shards are with the tribe chiefs, Tail’s shard has been lost with the Tail chieftess, for the last six years
- Sisu confirms that she is drawn to the Gem shards and can direct Raya to each shard

#### Naamari pinch

> **HILLTOP, TAIL**

- On a hilltop, Naamari inspects the footprints of Tuk-tuk. Her own Serlot sniffs the tracks. Four Fang soldiers on their own Serlots flank her.
- One of them point out that:
 1. Tail is infested with Druun, Raya's good as stone
 2. Retrieving the scroll isn't worth the risk
- Namaari turns to him, sharply spitting, "Then go back home." The soldiers side-eye amongst themselves.
- Namaari hops onto her mount, "Or, follow me and make things right for Fang."
	- Namaari pushes her mount onwards, leaving the rest of them to continue on.

### Tail’s Forgotten Gem Shard

#### Tail Temple

> **TEMPLE, TAIL**

- Sisu leads Raya, on Tuk-tuk, to uncover a hidden limestone temple in a cave of a cliff
- Raya explains: each Gem shard was claimed by each of the chiefs of the five lands.
- We get a splitscreen, showing each tribe chief holding a weapon that has been embedded with their Gem shard.
	- Heart's Gem is embedded into Chief Benja's whip-sword [keris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kris)
	- Fang's Gem is embedded into Chief Virana's scepter-[trishula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trishula)
	- Talon's Gem is embedded into each of Chief Dang Hai's four [karambits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karambit)
	- Spine's Gem in a tipped [kudi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kudi_(knife)) of a bamboo spear
	- Tail's Gem in a [kujang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kujang_(weapon))
- Sisu questions why she is dressed in human clothes.
	- Raya says they have to disguise so they don't attract attention.
	- Sisu rebuffs, "But don't people love us, after all we've done for them? Won't the tribes finally unite if they see me?"
	- Raya replies, "All the other tribes have bad people, just like Namaari. Trust me."
- Sisu exclaims they should have brought a housewarming gift for the Tail chieftess!
	- Raya mockingly waves, "I have loads of lemongrass to trade with, I've seen people go nuts over some common Heart herb. But this temple is abandoned."
- They work through the temple; and avoid traps.
	- Sisu, "Wow, you're real good at slipping and sliding."
	- Raya: "Yea, my dad trained me for this with our own version at home."
	- Sisu stops, confused. "These traps wouldn't stop the Druun."
	- Raya replies, "They're to stop people." Sisu huffs in disappointment.
	- Raya also remarks that people from Tail are naturally good navigators/infiltrators, so these traps are totally in-character
- We skip the awkward setup dialogue about Sisu being "good at swimming".

> **THRONE ROOM, TEMPLE, TAIL**

- They enter the temple throne room, and see the skeleton of the Tail chieftess, clutching her artefect.
	- They retrieve Tail's Gem weapon artefact: a [kujang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kujang_(weapon)).
- They celebrate!
- Sisu suddenly falls to the ground, transforming into a human version of herself.
	- "I’ve lost my dragon form because the Gem is shattered! We can’t take our sweet time. But now that you don't have to disguise me, the rest should be easy!"
	- "This one was easy, but the rest of them are being held by a bunch of no-good *binturis*."

#### Fang Ambush

- “Raya!”, a voice calls out. “I'm sorry I made you feel that way.”
	- Raya turns around; it's Namaari, adult, alone, just pulling herself up onto a landing that’s a stone's throw away. (She didn’t see dragon!Sisu)
	- Raya grits, "Naamari."
	- "Oh!" Sisu exclaims, "The Namaari who backstabbed you fifteen years ago!"
- "I'm sorry, Raya. I was a kid, just wanting to please my mother."
	- "Oh, please. You make the worst rumours we heard about Fang sound like children's fables. You caused the world… to come to this! You took away my father."
- "I… did a wrong thing. And I realised I needed to make things right. So I led a team of scholars to study the ancient texts, to find some solution… then, six years ago, a Scroll was stolen from me by a woman and her Pandolin."
	- Raya waves the stolen Scroll, "Don’t worry, I'm never stepping foot in Fang again. Fang is the last tribe I'd work with, and you're the last person from Fang I'd trust."
- Raya continues, "Besides, I've already found Sisu."
	- Sisu waves her human arm, “That's me, Sisudatu the *Dragon*!”
	- Namaari arches a confused eyebrow.
	- Sisu: “Raya, she says she's sorry. We should work with her! Then we can get the Gem artefact from Fang, then that's just two more to go!”
- Namaari: "Raya… I don't know who is this crazy person you've convinced to be Sisu… but she's right. It looks like you're collecting all the five Gem artefacts, how do you expect to reassemble the Dragon Gem if you only have four? Unless…"
	- "Don't worry about the Gem shards, Namaari. Worry about the landslide…"
	- "What landsli-"
- Raya triggers a bobby trap, causing some loose rocks to fall onto Namaari. The temple collapses.
	- Namaari's caught in the landslide and needs to retreat.
	- Raya grabs Sisu by the hand. "Run!"
	- Raya blows on a seemingly silent whistle

> **TEMPLE, TAIL**

- Raya and Sisu burst out of the main Temple doors
	- Fang soldiers jump out of hiding!
	- so does Tuk-Tuk! In response to Raya’s whistle.
		- He knocks the Fang soldiers away
- Raya and Sisu mount on Tuk-tuk, and pull away
	- Soldiers launch in hot pursuit of Raya on their Serlots, one stays back to help Namaari
	- "See, Sisu!" Raya shouts, "Namaari had backup! We can't trust Fang!"

### Namaari Chase

#### Fang Chase Sequence

> **LIMESTONE CLIFFS, TAIL**

- Tuk-Tuk is a respectably fast tank, but the predator Serlots are are like ATV’s
	- Tuk-Tuk’s scale armour and Raya’s whip-sword repels the Fang attacks from all around
	- Namaari eventually joins the ranks of her soldiers on her own Serlot
- Let's extend this chase sequence by adding some more mythical elements!
	- Perhaps some Druun pop up.
	- Namaari is delayed as she stops her chase to defend her people. She can actually take on at least one Druun herself with normal weapons.
	- Perhaps they use some wild local vegetation to their advantage
	- using magical properties, maybe some giant opposite-mimosa leaves that expand when touched
- Raya gets lightly wounded by Namaari
	- Raya reinforces her point, "Naamari just wants to steal the other tribes' Gem shards to make Fang stronger!"
- Eventually, the chase leads them to a narrow cliffside, with a large lake basin below
	- “We need to lose them!”
	- Sisu exclaims, "The Druun and the Serlot mounts [large hybrid cats] are both afraid of water!"
	- Raya rebutts, "No way!"
	- But as Namaari gains distance, close enough to touch them…
- Sisu yanks the reins on Tuk-tuk, veering him sideways and hard launching them (Tuk-tuk, Sisu, and Raya) a good distance off the cliffside and into the the water below
	- The Serlots completely halt, refusing to go into the water
	- One Fang soldier dismounts and dives in
	- Namaari to the rest: “Follow me to the docks!”

> **LAKE, TAIL**

- SPLASH!
- PANIC. Raya is flailing all about. She takes in gulps of water – she can’t swim.
	- she was also lightly wounded
	- Quick FLASHBACKS of when she fell off Heart’s bridge, her dad turning to stone…
- Sisu tries but can't transform into dragon form
	- (She has to remain human so that they can't just mount on Sisu and swim off, they will need a boat)
	- but she has human limbs. She tries swimming like a dragon, which kind of works
- Sisu then notices Raya struggling. She fetches her and drags her upright
	- it's a battle, trying to save a flailing person in water. But Sisu is adept enough
- "*Ika*. *Ika*! Stop resisting. I'm here to help."
	- Sisu calls out to Tuk-Tuk: "I'll come back for you!"
	- Tuk-tuk wrestles with the one Fang soldier who dived in. He’s winning — [pandolins are great swimmers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangolin#cite_note-Mondadori-31). He does a cute wave back to Sisu before continuing pummelling.
- As Raya catches her breaths, we now see that the lake is a dock for a dozen-or-so fishing ships, mostly unoccupied
- Sisu swims over to the nearest boat and tosses Raya aboard
	- Raya flails around, confirming that she's touching land again
	- Sisu swims back towards Tuk-tuk
	- Back on the boat, a shadow is cast over Raya
	- Raya, soaking wet, looks up:

#### Boun and the Steamboat

> **STEAMBOAT, LAKE, TAIL**

- There's a Tail kid, 15 years old. Frying wok in one hand, spatula in another.
- "Welcome to the Kumandra-famous Steamboat! My name is Boun, I’ll be your server today! Shrimp--"
	- Raya, still coughing out water, "Where's the captain?"
	- "I am the captain! Anyway, like I was sayin', shrimp is the fruit of the sea. You can barbecue it, boil it, broil it, bake it, saute it. There's shrimp barbecue, boiled shrimp stew, broiled shrimp stew…"
- As Boun yaps on, Raya looks over her shoulder: Namaari's Fang squad has already made their way towards the coast. There's a boardwalk that extends a short while, and the Serlots just have to hop across a few ships to get to the Steamboat. T-1 minute.
	- Raya, finally getting her breath, speaks over him: "Can you just drive the boat out a little bit -- but not too far out!"
	- Boun: "Oh, I see, you want the steamboat-at-sea Tail experience. It'll cost you extra!"
	- Raya glances around for people at the other ships.
	- Boun: "Sorry, until sunset, I'm the only sailor in this lake who can serve you!"
	- "What, why?!"
	- Boun, "…because today is Midsummer on a leap year? And the men don't drive their boats out or do any work, to spend time with their family today? -- And I'm not sixteen yet."
- Boun double-takes. "Wait, you don't know… you're not from Tail. Sorry, I can't serve you."
	- Raya: "No-no, I am Tail! Yes, I'd like the out-on-the-ocean experience."
	- Boun: "Momma always said--"
- SPLASH! The boat totters as Tuk-tuk climbs aboard.
	- Boun: "WHA-WHAT IS THAT! Please, don't hurt me!"
	- Raya: "Don't freak out! That's my pet mount, Tuk-tuk, he's a Pandolin. He's friendly."
- Tuk-tuk uses his mouth to pull a human hand out of the water -- it's Sisu.
	- Sisu greets Boun: "*S’lam*! The water is *so* refreshing on a Midsummer noon--"
	- Boun: "Are you Tail?"
	- Raya tries to mouth-signal to Sisu…
	- Sisu spins around and checks her bum, thinking she hasn't shifted back properly, "*Ashka*! Wait… no tail. Just a normal-shaped human *punggung*."
- Boun: "You’re not from Fang, are you? Please don’t hurt me."
	- Sisu: "We have gifts! Raya, you said you have lemongrass?"
	- Boun brightens, hops over, "Lemongrass?! No way! I thought they were extinct!"
- Namaari's Serlot starts racing down the boardwalk towards them
	- Raya shoves a fistful of herbs into Boun's hands. "Drive!"
- Boun stashes the lemongrass in a basket and hops into the driver's seat, and launches the boat full-throttle
	- it's not fast, but it's enough
	- the Serlots start jumping across the vacant ships to close the gap—
	- but the gang narrowly make their escape

#### Fang Regroup

> **DOCKS, LAKE, TAIL**

- One of the Fang soldiers notes that
 1. Raya can now escape anywhere, they won't keep up with the boat
 2. they'll likely go to Talon next for the next Gem shard
- Namaari commands not to pursue;
	- Talon and Spine are strong and dangerous territories
	- She chooses one of her elite soldiers to prepare to follow and spy on Raya
		- must not interfere. just collect info
- Namaari needs to head back to Fang to talk with her mother, Chief Virana
	- she needs to know what Raya is really trying to do
	- (Namaari doesn't actually understand the scroll she showed when she was younger)

> **FADE TO:**

### Settling into the Steamboat

#### Trauma

> **STEAMBOAT, LAKE, TAIL**

- Raya looks out: Namaari's squad retreats behind a mountain
- Raya peeks at Boun: his hands works fast with a chopping knife, slicing up the prawns and vegetables quite expertly
- Raya peers over the boat. She bites her lip in discomfort, and scurries back.
	- Sisu notices this: "*Ika*. What was that back there?"
	- They whisper out of earshot of Boun.
	- Raya deflects. "Yea. You didn't listen to me, I said not to go into the water. We'll dock as soon as possible and continue to Talon on Tuk-tuk."
	- "Those cat things can outrun Tuk-tuk. If I had control of my full dragon power, I could fly us wherever, but I don’t, so for now a boat is still faster for long-distance travel!"
	- Tuk-tuk lounges lazily, exhausted from the previous chase
- Sisu: "Besides, we're also safer from the Druun on the water."
	- Raya: "We can't be completely sure we can trust Boun, or any other sailor."
	- Sisu: “Get your own boat”
	- Raya: “I never learnt how to drive a boat.”
	- Sisu: "You've tracked down every river's end in Kumandra, but you never learnt how to sail? Kumandra isn't that big. If you learnt how to sail, you would've taken much quicker than six years."
	- Raya, "You got me, I just can’t swim."
	- Sisu: "Then why didn't you learn? And come to think of it, if you assembled people to spread out, finding all the river's ends would've taken less than a few months!"
	- Raya: "You can't trust anyone!"
	- Sisu: "If you want the tribes to trust each other and unite under One Kumandra, you need to start by trusting me. Raya, what’s the truth?"
- Raya sighs, downcast.
	- with voiced-over'ed FLASHBACKS:
	- "When my dad threw me into the water, to save me, the last thing I saw was him turning to stone. I wanted to cry, scream, wail. But how could I, when the river was drowning me?"
- We see young Raya spasming in the water like adult Raya previously
	- never dying, never living
	- the river goes on for a long while…
	- "So every time I fall into deep waters, my body does this *thing*…"
	- NEXT FLASHBACK: Raya, a bit older now, trying to jump across the River, but falls in. She spasms again.
- Back to present: "Every time, I'm reminded how my dad should've never given his trust to the other tribes."
- Sisu: "I'm sorry I pushed us in. But Boun, he's just a kid, he's not the Namaari who hurt you all those years ago. Namaari now isn't the same Namaari who hurt you all those years ago either. It seems a little unfair to automatically assume the worst."
- Raya rolls her head around, deliberating. "I've been unfair to Boun, but Namaari is a different story."

#### Late Lunch

- "Soup’s boiling!" calls Boun
	- Raya sits up and goes over to Boun.
	- "And now, for the legendary garnish!"
- "Wait!!"
	- Raya swaps out the herbs in Boun's basket (which were actually padipepper) with a whole head of actual lemongrass from her satchel
	- Boun: "The colour's different."
	- Raya lies: "These ones are fresher, they just grow like that."
- Boun takes the actual lemongrass, expertly slices them up, and scatters it into the steamboat
- "It's about the theatrics, the customers love the theatrics!"
	- Boun takes a test scoop — he dramatically falls to his knees in awe
	- "*WAH!* I never thought shrimp steamboat could get any better."
- Boun serves up a bowl for Raya first — but notices that Raya's apprehensive
	- "You haven't even tasted it yet"
	- "Oh, it's just that. I've lived on my own dried jackfruit for the past 15 years of my life… I’m not saying you've poisoned my food! Haha! You wouldn't poison my food! I wouldn't poison *your* food! Hahahahaha….."
	- Sisu: "Quit being weird and eat the stew."
	- Raya: "…all I'm saying is that you never know! You know!"
	- Sisu forces a spoonful of stew in her mouth
- Raya protests at first, but then she surrenders, groaning at how good it is
	- (just like Young Namaari in Episode 1 tasting the full stew)
- Raya mumbles: "I haven't tasted food like this in 15 years…"
	- (Young Namaari says this too in E1)
	- Boun distributes the rest, throwing new items into the steamboat
- Sisu: "Hey, Boun, if it's ok with you, we'd like you to sail us to Talon."
	- "Talon! Another tribe. I've never left Tail all my life."
	- Raya: "Or just drop us off at the next stop, we'll get our own boat—"
	- "I think I could—"
	- Raya: "No, we don't want to trouble you. The next stop."
- Boun: "But first I'll need to make a quick stop on the way. There's something I need to do."
	- "What is it?"
	- "Oh. Just family matters. Midsummer things. Anyways, shrimp is…"
	- Raya squints suspiciously.

#### Namaari Interlude

> **DRAGON GRAVEYARD, WILDERNESS - DUSK**

- Namaari and her soldiers pass through a field.
	- Petrified dragons lay in heroic poses—they look merely hand-sculpted
- Namaari solemnly (genuinely?) pays her respects, more so than the others

### The Visit

#### Suspicion

> **STEAMBOAT, RIVER, SWAMP, TAIL OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT**

- It's dark-out. Fierce winds cause the Steamboat to rock back-and-forth on the turbulent River. Dry lightning flashes.
- Raya paces around. "What if he's arranging an assault with his village?"
	- Sisu: "Boun has been gone for 5 minutes. You must have *damar*. You were so worried he'd poison our porridge, and see, we're fine!"
- Raya: "But what if that's his trick?"
	- Sisu: "What if, what if. What about *what is*?"
- Raya: "What *is* the reason why he made us stay on his boat?"
	- Sisu kicks back on a couch. "Our comfort? He also told us to watch after the boat."
	- "I could steal his boat!"
	- "He *trusts* you that you wouldn't."
- Raya shakes her head and jumps out of the boat onto land. She sighs at the safety of solid ground.
	- "No one trusts like that anymore."
	- "Raya, no! Wait! I don't know how boat anchors work!"
- Raya wades to shore in the ankle-height muddy waters.
	- She spots Boun's footprints in the mud. She follows it.

> **SWAMP, TAIL OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT**

- Raya picks up her pace, weaving through the mangroves with determination
	- She brandishes her weapons; Heart's whip-sword in one hand, Tail's kujang in the other
- She reaches a hut. Through a window, a candle reveals the shadows of Boun and three figures inside
	- Boun whispers, "Dad… Mom… She has lemongrass AND Tail's gem shard… what do we do?"
	- Raya narrows her eyes. Gotcha.
- Raya sneaks up, readies herself, and bursts in through the door.

#### Mistakes

> **HUT, SWAMP, TAIL OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT**

- Boun turns around. His face is red with tears. He's alone, kneeling before three stone statues — his petrified family.
- Raya drops her weapons in horror. "Oh… family matters… I'm so sorry…"
- Boun: "Wait, who's watching the Steamboat?"

> **SWAMP, TAIL OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT**

- Raya and Boun race through the swamp, vines swaying in the dry storm
- "Help!!!" cries Sisu. Tuk-tuk wails. Tempest. Lightning. Thunder.

> **STEAMBOAT, SWAMP, TAIL OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT**

- The ship had drifted to the far coast of the 15m-wide river, splintering against rocks
- A bunch of Druun manage to climb on and tear apart the ship
- Sisu and Tuk-tuk hardly buffer the Druuns
- Raya grapples across the river with her whip-sword and expertly fights off some Druun
- Boun swings across a vine, landing on the Steamboat's roof next to Raya.
	- "Give me Tail's artefact! Let me help you!"
	- Raya ignores him, and demolishes the Druun
- But because of her light wound from Namaari from earlier, the final Druun makes a heavy wound on Raya, knocking her down into the river
	- the satchel containing Tail's artefact was flung onto the roof next to Boun
	- but Raya's feet are caught by Sisu on the lower deck
	- Raya's upper half gets submerged under the currents, and she starts spazzing out
	- Raya pulls herself out of the water
	- from the tattered roof, a Druun looks down at her
- The Druun on the roof jumps down onto Raya…
	- There's a rapid flash of blue.
- Pulling the camera back: Boun takes Tail's Gem artefact (we'll be referring to it as “the Kujang") and slices up the Druun as it falls mid-air
	- Boun has chef slicing skills.
- The Druun vaporises.
- Boun expertly cuts some slack ropes, causing the Steamboat to recenter itself in the River
	- Large cloths unfurl throughout the ship's exteriors, shielding them in silence and peace
- Raya passes out from exhaustion.

#### Resolution

> **STEAMBOAT, RIVER, TALON OUTSKIRTS - DAY**

- Sisu shakes Raya awake: “We’re here.”
- Boun steadily brings the tattered Steamboat towards some meagre docks
- Raya sees her wounds bandaged: “Thanks, Sisu.”
	- Sisu: I don’t know how to bandage wounds.
	- Raya spots the roll of bandage besides Boun. He did it for her.
- Raya: “It’s already noon?”
	- Sisu: “Yeah, lunch is ready.”
	- Raya: “I’ve always woken up myself before sunrise. But for the first time in *years*, I’m waking up to voices other than Tuk-Tuk. I feel safe. On a boat.”
	- Sisu nods over to Boun
- Raya walks up to him. “Thanks for saving me… I’m sorry about the Steamboat.”
	- Raya, “Sorry. For assuming the worst of you. And for what happened to your family.”
	- Boun, “That’s Kumandra, I guess.”
- “It doesn’t have to be. Boun, would you still be willing to take us to Talon — I’ll buy your boat repairs… do you trust me?”
	- “No.”
	- Sigh. Raya nods in acceptance. She opens her mouth--
	- Boun: “No, not *yet*. Maybe, in time. Besides, the ship needs repairs.”
	- Raya: “*Gus-gus*, captain. Let’s sail.”
	- Sisu smiles.


# RAYA E4 - Talon

> **Episode 4: Kumandra’s Notoriety**

Theme: Kumandra’s repeat interactions

> **🚧 WIP**, come talk to me IRL for more heh

## Ideas

- repeat interactions—**REPUTATION**
- switcheroo fake artefacts, how to trust the real one?
- Boun and Sisu on the hunt for a ship component fix part, that broke by the Druun because Raya doubted Boun was going offshore to memoralize parents
- dragon-fruit
- remember to remind Raya’s spasm PTSD once
- Heart refugees undercover in Talon
	- Raya is excited to meet her own people, trusting them!
	- but they betray her — you can’t even trust your own
	- foreshadowing Raya’s betrayal?
- masks, costumes, disguises
	- oh there’s a Mask Festival
		- the idea is that the real dragons/help are the friends we make along the way(?)
	- a chase scene where everyone looks the same
	- Sisu doesn’t want/need to wear a mask
	- would be cool if she turns into a dragon, people think she’s a costume
		- people are just so numb with lies that they don’t know the truth
- Every trust can be broken for a price
	- Raya bargains to buy off Talon’s Gem shard by betrayal
- “Everyone’s a fake, anyways. A dishonest man, you can trust to be dishonest.”
	- A greedy man, you can trust to win as the highest bidder
- Namaari’s scout as an active agent
	- the scout steals Raya’s whip-sword artefact and returns to Namaari
	- Raya is more angry at Namaari — it’s her last attachment to her father, as well as a Gem shard
	- Naamari actually hadn’t commanded it. She sighs and makes plans to make use of it. She’s still upset with her scout, and decommissions him. Her true motives are still murky.
	- now the gang ends the story down with one gem shard in the hands of the enemy.
	- they will encounter Namaari in Spine.
- two Talon locals: one child, one cynical parent figure
- Raya’s stuck — she sacrifices(?) herself, resigns to die (water? Druun?)
	- she tells Boun and Talons: follow Sisu. She trusts them with the artefacts (she’s been stingy with them all this while). It’s really her last moment. She echoes her father’s One Kumandra.
	- The parent figure believes Raya.The parent figure switches places, so that the parent figure gets turned to stone, trusting that Raya will really turn all the stone people back.
		- maybe the parent figure lost someone to stone
	- the Talon kid now joins them on their journey, having to revive parent figure
	- maybe it’s the kid who believes and self-sacrifices
	- maybe the Fang scout imposter is here too, still taking an artefact for themselves
- Namaari subplot
	- early scene showing dispatching of scout?
	- talk with one of her party, an older guy who remembers before the Scattering
	- they have to shortcut through Heart to get to Fang early
		- Namaari’s also PTSD’d at Heart
		- maybe she got the mentor’s brother petrified at Heart
		- they don’t know the full truth? Virana pushed the false narrative that Raya shot first after leading Namaari into a trap?
	- They get to Fang by the end of the episode — they need to be in Spine by the next
- Sisu gets captured
- Raya says she doesn’t trust friends
	- but Raya actually has one Talon contact/confidante from long ago
	- that person had been assembling a team
- fourth guy who trains the Ongi monkeys
	- but after the failure, the monkey trainer gets petrified — the monkeys follow the gang
	- maybe he spends more time with Sisu, since he’s not a major suspect
- rivers drying
	- older buildings are higher up above the water, where the water level used to be — the “center” is higher up
	- newer buildings, at the fringes, especially docks, are lower
- needing a team
	- Raya has no reputation, can’t get anywhere
	- she needs a group of people to vouch for her
	- these people who have built up reputation and trustworthiness, only to break it for Raya
	- they are inherently betray trust in order to work in the team
		- they have all the reasons to double-triple-cross
- thematic stances
	- **simplified reputation**
		- one-strike collab—Boun, Sisu
		- one-strike betray—Raya
	- don’t play the reputation game—they really lose out (**avoidant reputation**)
	- collab for reputation
		- just to betray for the highest bidder (**fleeting reputation**)
		- some really try to gain reputation
			- but the ones who are very popular and people vouch for, are the ones who have betrayed to get those popular votes
			- yeah so **false reputation**
				- the recruiter has **fake reputation**—he has vouchers, but substance is fake
		- **inconclusive reputation**—perverted positive, waiting good but too long
- setting
	- reputation is everything.
	- you can’t use previous strategy of “always betray” because your reputation shows

## Snowflake Method

- Raya must work with a team to obtain Talon’s Gem shard (to save the world)
- Raya enters Talon, ready to semi-trust trustworthy allies. She assembles a necessary team to obtain the Gem shard. She gets pressed by an unknown Fang Spy, besides her own teammates. She must decide whether to sellout her sucky team, or keep her own promises.
- Character Profiles
	- Raya’s goal is to get Talon’s Gem shard from the princess. However, she has a one-strike reputation. She needs to learn how to rightly evaluate the overtime reputation of others—and how to build her own.
- Quarters
	- Q1: Raya attempts Goal #1 of her heist, but fails for insufficient reputation/group-work. In the fallout of her failure, she reluctantly works with a team.
	- Q2: During the Ghost Mask Festival, the gang kidnap the wandering Talon princess. A present Fang spy and Raya’s mega-heist is revealed, disrupts the plan. But with collaboration, they achieve another Goal #1.
	- Q3: The gang solidifies, trading secrets in trust. This makes them more effective. Suddenly, the whip-sword is stolen. Raya interrogates the group and they fall apart. Raya does something huge. Sisu is captured by the traitor. The Fang spy plans to release Druun onto the Talon floating city (epic. but why?).
	- Q4: Raya, alone, goes to save Sisu. Sisu is freed to push back the Druun. But too weak alone, Raya is captured to be petrified—she makes her final speech. It rouses the one of the pair to sacrifice themselves. The other person escapes with Raya, Sisu and Boun.

## Character Profiles

	- Noi, Ngom, Ngang, Ngyet, Muong, Phu, Vien, Ding
- the fake princess
	- princess faker — nephew/niece? how do they know how to fake?

		- recognised the GEMS, didn’t know that was the Raya — stole just to be safe
		- Raya assumes she recruited Vien, but it’s all planned by recruiter
			- recruiter stationed VIen at the package for Raya
			- means really knew it was Raya
- the metalsmith
	- the one who embedded Raya’s gem into the Whip-Sword
	- Raya had trusted this person with the knowledge of the Gem
- the spy
	- also a replacement sailor, intended to replace Boun
		- but since spy, Boun needs to step back in
- actually the Talon family-backstabber from E1?
- one of them needs to be Boun’s replacement sailor — but also ends up being the spy

## Plot Outline

	- Everyone knows Raya is in town for the gem
		- Think: Boun spilled the beans?
- E5: (claim the prize):
	- Talon on lockdown
	- Tuk-Tuk comes out,
	- missing Sisu? Noi?
- E6: (pay the price):
	- start with:
		- whip-sword stolen. → sets up the desperation of Raya’s sacrifice
		- she’s upset. interrogates the group.
	- ~~someone tries to bribe the spy — the spy reveals! disaster!~~
	- parent-figure betrays child-figure!
	- monkey man gets petrified!
	- team scrambles
	- Raya/Sisu gets caught to retrieve the Gem.
- E7: (clashing worlds):
	- She betrays others?
- E8: (battling changes):
	- child-figure double-double cross sacrifice
		- child-figure realises this isn’t the world he wants to live in
		- child self-sacrifices, in hope in Sisu
		- Later, parent joins Raya with that guilt.
	- Raya finds out whipsword was stolen

## Workspace

### E1 - Comfort

#### Namaari/Khaan Hook

> **EXT. MOUNTAINTOP - DUSK**

- Namaari and her squad are surveying from a lookout point, making camp
- A glow appears, just on the horizon, along a river
	- Junior Soldier: “Khaan could’ve arrived sooner at Talon.”
	- her Serlot roars a yawn.
	- Namaari, “Then Raya will know Khaan is a Fang scout, barging in on a large noisy Serlot.”
- Namaari turns back to an older, decorated soldier
	- “General Thaam, can’t we find another route back home to Fang?”
	- “Princess, if you want to arrive home in five days, without meeting any Druun, then we need to go through Heart.”
	- Namaari’s reluctant.
	- “I know how much that night hurt you, fifteen years go. I was there, too. But if Raya is out to steal the Gem shards from every tribe, then your mother needs to make plans.”
	- (What? Namaari, hurt? Wasn’t she the one who backstabbed Raya?) #payme
- “Okay, General. Let’s hope Khaan succeeds in…”

#### Goodbye Boun

> **EXT. TALON - NIGHT**

- Chyron: **TALON**
	- (about five days after E1, but it’s not explicit to audience)
- some establishing shots: the floating platforms, the merchant boats, lanterns, noisy crowds

> **EXT. DOCKS, TALON - NIGHT**

- The battle-torn Steamboat pulls into Talon docks. The gang steps out and takes a walk.
- Sisu ogles: I didn’t know Talon became so… beautiful…
	- Boun picks a perfect lychee out of an overflowing crate
	- Boun: If only the families in Tail could’ve banded together like this…
	- Raya snatches it: Yeah, a band of scammers and frauds. That’s fake.
	- Raya discreetly tosses the lychee into the water. Fish snap over each other to win it. One fish slurps it, but on biting down on it—its life and colour drains to grey. It floats up, dead.
- Boun: “Then why do people still trade with them?”
	- Raya: “Because like it or not. Without Talon, the tribes wouldn’t trade with each other at all. Kumandra would’ve really fallen.
	- Just keep your guard up. Be careful who you buy from.”
- Raya: Reminds me, the payment for the past week of delicacies on the Steamboat… and for saving my life. (gesturing to her wound that Boun bandaged)
	- Boun’s eyes widen as a bunch of coins drop into his hand
	- Raya: Double of what I promised. I’m sorry I assumed the worst of you. Purchase your ship repairs and go crazy with cooking ingredients!
- “Thank you, Raya! And good luck with stealing Talon’s Gem artefact.”
	- Raya double-takes, sternly: “What?! Shhhh! How—? Never mind. If people find out, they’ll—don’t you tell ANYONE about this.”
		- #payme later, the whole of Talon finds out. Raya blames Boun, but it’s the spy.
	- “But… can’t _I_ know about it?”
	- “No.”
	- “…okay. I didn’t tell you about what happened to my family, either.”
	- “In the end, we both still got what we wanted!”
	- Boun sadly nods, shrugs, poking at his disfigured ship. “I’m going to find ship repair parts now. Raya, I trust that you’re a good guy… but I’ll never know for sure.” They part ways.



#### Hello, Talon

- Raya heel-turns, but grabs onto Sisu (for fear of water)
- Raya monologues: Our schedule is three days late because the boat got damaged. Tuk-Tuk is swimming nearby. I’ve got my whistle to call him when we need to escape. Now Sisu, you—
- Sisu’s exasperated: “Boun already knows. Let him in!”
	- Raya: He’s… too young.
	- Sisu: We need to travel by boat if you want to avoid the Druun AND be faster than Namaari.
	- Raya: Fine. We’ll find another sailor. Boun knows too much.
- Raya: we need to get new clothes to blend in. Follow close.

> **EXT. MARKET STREET, TALON - NIGHT**

- Raya leads Sisu down a street
	- crowds jostle, vendors haggle prices
	- the oddly-dressed pair are singled out by the vendors, hard to move
	- vendors:
		- “Aha! This headscarf goes beautifully with your traditional Tail wear!”
		- “first purchase, half price!”
		- “hello ladies, I’m from Tail too! Let me show you around!”
	- Sisu: Wow, everyone’s so friendly!
		- Sisu gets caught by a lotion salesperson lol—Raya, Raya, give me money to buy this lotion

> **EXT. ALLEY, TALON - NIGHT**

- Raya pulls Sisu around into an alley
	- Raya comforts herself: Soon, we’ll be at Spine. On solid ground. With saner people.
- Raya prostrates herself on the boardwalk and reaches under. She retrieves a bundled package.
	- Raya: I’ve prepared this last time I was here. There’s local clothes and supplies.
	- The pair put on the local clothing outerwear (Raya backpacks the rest)
- Sisu picks up a note attached to the package.
	- Sisu: Hey, what’s this? “Guard up. Fang spy in Talon. Arrived few days ago.” You wrote this to yourself?
- (they kena attacc)

#### The Plan

…



- Sisu: You have a friend?!
- Raya: I have an accomplice.
- Raya: Sisu, this is Nan.
- masks



### E2 – Need

#### Meet Noi, Nan and Ner

- three Talon locals
	- we find out later that one of them is definitely a Fang spy
	- all three are frauds in some way, though
	- who’s the spy?
- Noi pretends to be the chieftan’s daughter
	- only during Mask Festival can Noi go around anonymously
	- Noi helps to get Raya to the palace
	- “Dang Hai only has sons…”

#### Getting to Dang Hai

#### Disaster

- Midpoint: realising there’s a Fang spy
	- only one of the gang knew about the plan

##### Namaari in Heart

#### False Victory with The Gem

- reveal Nan is Noi’s parent figure

#### The Trap

#### Sacrifice

- one of them sells Raya out to the local Talon authorities
- Raya looks back; there isn’t much time. The Druun approach.
	- “My real name is Raya, daughter of Chief Benja of the tribe of Heart. The land of Kumandra fell apart because I made a mistake. Sisudatu is the Last Dragon. If you re-assemble the Gem shards from each tribe, she will revive everyone who was turned to stone. Don’t trust anyone. Or do. I don’t know, I just know that I trust you. I have to.”
	- (that’s a banger voiceover snippet for a trailer)
	- She throws over the satchel containing the Gem weapons.
	- She looks away. “I’m sorry bá, I couldn’t do it.”
- Noi takes Raya’s place
	- “Noi, she’s just another liar!”
	- “No! For the first time in my life, I’m hearing the truth.”
	- Noi exchanges places with Raya: she gets petrified.

#### Resolution

- The Steamboat sails off
- Raya files through the satchel
	- She double-takes. Ruffles it again. Turns its contents out.
	- The Kujang. The Karambit.
	- Heart’s Whip-Keris is missing.
- Raya freaks out. Wails. Angry.


# RAYA E5 - Spine

## Ideas

- "The gem isn't a weapon!" Well now it really is made into weapons, and actually helps against Druun.
- Spine does need their super-staff to survive, and are willing to give it up on Sisu's authenticity
- [Jianzi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jianzi) / đá cầu / sipa / capteh
	- except it's like combat juggling
	- each team has to keep "alive" their dacau, whilst trying to take down the other teams'
	- maybe they have three each, and can use them to hit others out of the air
		- the lighter women are launched into the air to spike opponents' balls out
	- soft combat is allowed!
	- there's a 2m deep pond in the center of the arena
		- Spine players abuse Raya not willing to cross into the pond
		- Raya must admit her fear of water,
			- or maybe be willing to stand underwater to boost her shorter teammates like Noi to land a spike
	- Namaari brings chilis from Fang to help with the cold
- lol one of those doors with an eye slider, where you have to answer a prompt with the correct passphrase
- they don't believe in dragons lol
- Raya's the avatar of the worst traits of the five nations lol
	- Old Kumandra
		- copycat
		- at first, they were all nice, and reciprocal
		- then when Namaari started cheating,
		- Raya (and Kumandra) copycats, always being untrusting from now on
	- Tail: generally untrusting
		- doubt enemies
		-  always cheat?
	- Talon: false deception
		- doubt friends
		- coop once – then cheat
		- repeat interactions
	- Spine: indifferent independence
		- doubt everyone (after once?)
		- grudger
		- will take handouts but won’t give
		- forever stuck in non-cooperation
		- needs to learn the non-zero sum game — if you don’t help others, they can’t help you, and you need help
	- Heart: champion conspiring
		- trust everyone?
		- always cooperate?
	- Fang: ruthless, internal trust
		- always cheat?—nah it gotta be more complex than that at this final stage
- they find a water redirection
	- Raya takes twice as long to find all river ends, because of all the redirection
