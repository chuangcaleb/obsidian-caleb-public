# RAYA - Index

This is my pitch for a Raya and the Last Dragon rewrite in a TV Series format.

After writing [[Disney's Raya – Cultural Review]] and suggesting some constructive criticism, I was inspired to stitch together a proof of concept outline — and as things usually do, they got out of hand.

It’s in a very rough beat sheet/outline form. It’s far from complete, yes, I just add more whenever I feel inspiration (+ motivation lol).

I’m very proud to show off the outline of at least the first two episodes — they are complete and self-contained. And I think I’m *cooking* with them.

This is also my first attempt using [Longform](https://github.com/kevboh/longform/tree/main) to compile individual notes into one mega output note → [[Disney's Raya - TV Series Pitch]].
