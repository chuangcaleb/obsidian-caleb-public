# RAYA E3 - Talon

## Episode 3 - Kumandra’s Faces

> Theme: Kumandra’s repeat interactions

%%

## Ideas

- switcheroo fake artefacts, how to trust the real one?
- Boun and Sisu on the hunt for a ship component fix part, that broke by the Druun because Raya doubted Boun was going offshore to memoralize parents
- dragon-fruit
- remember to show off Raya’s spasm PTSD once
- Heart refugees undercover in Talon
	- Raya is excited to meet her own people, trusting them!
	- but they betray her — you can’t even trust your own
	- foreshadowing Raya’s betrayal?
- masks, costumes, disguises
	- oh it’s a Mask Festival
		- the idea is that the real dragons/help are the friends we make along the way(?)
	- a chase scene where everyone looks the same
	- Sisu doesn’t want/need to wear a mask
	- would be cool if she turns into a dragon, people think she’s a costume
		- people are just so numb with lies that they don’t know the truth
- Every trust can be broken for a price
	- Raya bargains to buy off Talon’s Gem shard by betrayal
- “Everyone’s a fake, anyways. A dishonest man, you can trust to be dishonest.”
	- A greedy man, you can trust to win as the highest bidder
- Namaari’s scout as an agent
	- the scout steals Raya’s whip-sword artefact and returns to Namaari
	- Raya is more angry at Namaari — it’s her last attachment to her father, as well as a Gem shard
	- Naamari actually hadn’t commanded it. She sighs and makes plans to make use of it. She’s still upset with her scout, and decommissions him. Her true motives are still murky.
	- now the gang ends the story down with one gem shard in the hands of the enemy.
	- they will encounter Namaari in Spine.
- two Talon locals: one child, one cynical parent figure
- Raya’s stuck — she sacrifices(?) herself, resigns to die (water? Druun?)
	- she tells Boun and Talons: follow Sisu. She trusts them with the artefacts (she’s been stingy with them all this while). It’s really her last moment. She echoes her father’s One Kumandra.
	- The parent figure believes Raya.The parent figure switches places, so that the parent figure gets turned to stone, trusting that Raya will really turn all the stone people back.
		- maybe the parent figure lost someone to stone
	- the Talon kid now joins them on their journey, having to revive parent figure
	- maybe it’s the kid who believes
	- maybe the Fang scout imposter is here too, still taking an artefact for themselves
- Namaari subplot
	- early scene showing dispatching of scout?
	- talk with one of her party, an older guy who remembers before the Great Division
	- they have to shortcut through Heart to get to Fang early
		- Namaari’s also PTSD’d at Heart
		- maybe she got the mentor’s brother petrified at Heart
		- they don’t know the full truth? Virana pushed the false narrative that Raya shot first after leading Namaari into a trap?
	- They get to Fang by the end of the episode — they need to be in Spine by the next
- Sisu gets captured
- Raya says she doesn’t trust friends
	- but Raya actually has one Talon contact/confidante from long ago
	- that person had been assembling a team
- fourth guy who trains the Ongi monkeys
	- but after the failure, the monkey trainer gets petrified — the monkeys follow the gang
	- maybe he spends more time with Sisu, since he’s not a major suspect

## Character Profiles

- Noi
	- princess faker — nephew/niece?
	- brings Raya directly into palace
	- maybe they gotta “try to locate her” in the Mask Festival
		- but Ngang is engineering this whole intro quest
	- while avoiding the actual Talon people
- Nom
- Ngang/Ngyet
	- recruiter
		- maybe: unsolicited recruiting? Raya doesn’t know they’re recruited
	- longtime Raya confidant
		- knows Raya’s water phobia?
		- knows Gem mission?
	- ex-guard / off-duty guard official
		- actually. so he’s gotta flee Talon with the gang at the end?
		- plan reveal
			- shows reverence for Sisu earlier
			- scoffs at human!Sisu. That can’t be Sisu.
- Muong
- Phu
- Vien
	- the monkey whisperer
	- steals the satchel at the start?
		- recognised the GEMS, didn’t know that was the Raya — stole just to be safe
		- Raya assumes she recruited Vien, but it’s all planned by recruiter
			- recruiter stationed VIen at the package for Raya
			- means really knew it was Raya
- actually the Talon family-backstabber from E1?

## Plot Outline

		- everyone confesses a secret
	- Kidnapping Dang Hai
	- Fang spy has been in Talon a long time
	- getting gem shard
	- Everyone knows Raya is in town for the gem
		- Think: Boun spilled the beans?
- E5: (claim the prize):

	- missing Sisu? Noi?
- E6: (pay the price):
	- someone tries to bribe the spy — the spy reveals! disaster!

### E1 - Comfort

#### Namaari/Khaang Hook

> **EXT. MOUNTAINTOP - DUSK**

- Namaari and her crew are surveying from a lookout point, making camp
- A glow appears, just on the horizon, along a river
	- Junior Soldier: “Khaang could’ve arrived sooner at Talon.”
	- her Serlot roars a yawn.
	- Namaari, “Raya will know Khaang is our scout, barging in on a large noisy Serlot.”
- Namaari turns back to an older soldier
	- “Admiral Thaanh, can’t we find another route back home to Fang?”
	- “Princess, if you want to arrive home in three days, without meeting any Druun, then we need to go through Heart.”
	- Namaari’s reluctant.
	- “I know how much that night hurt you, fifteen years go. I was there, too. But if Raya is out to steal the Gem shards from every tribe, then your mother needs to make plans.”
	- (What? Namaari, hurt? Wasn’t she the one who backstabbed Raya?) #payme
- “Okay, Admiral. Let’s hope Khaang succeeds in…”

#### Goodbye Boun

> **EXT. TALON - NIGHT**

- Chyron: **TALON**
	- (five days later), but it’s ambiguous
- some establishing shots: the floating platforms, the merchant boats, lanterns, noisy crowds

> **EXT. DOCKS, TALON - NIGHT**

- The battle-torn Steamboat pulls into Talon docks. The gang steps out and takes a walk.
- Sisu ogles: I didn’t know Talon became so beautiful…
	- Raya: After the Druun returned fifteen years ago, Talon fully moved their whole tribe onto their lake.
	- Boun: If only the families in Tail could’ve banded together like this…
	- Raya: Like a band of scammers and frauds? Watch out for fake parts.
- Raya: Reminds me, the payment for your past week of delicacies on the Steamboat. And for saving my life. (gesturing to her wound that Boun bandaged)
	- Boun’s eyes widen as a bunch of coins drop into his hand
	- Raya: Double what was promised. I’m sorry I assumed the worst of you. Purchase your ship repairs and go crazy with cooking ingredients.
- “Thank you, Raya. And good luck with stealing Talon’s Gem artefact.”
	- Raya double-takes, sternly: “What?! Shhhh! How—? Nevermind. Don’t you tell anyone about this.”
		- #payme the whole of Talon finds out. Raya blames Boun, but it’s the spy.
	- “But… can’t _I_ know about it?”
	- “Nobody can know.”
	- “…Okay.”
	- “…Boun? Tell your parents, that Raya of the tribe of Heart says, their son was very noble.”
	- Boun nods, shrugs. They part ways.

%%
- Boun reaches out his hand at the first stall for a fruit.
	- Raya catches his hand and leads him away. She whispers, “That’s fake.”
	- Sisu: “Fake?” They regroup away and look around at the stalls.
	- Raya: “They’re almost all fake. They’re banded together alright, a band of scammers and frauds.”
	- “Why do people still work with them?”
	- “Because like it or not. Without Talon, the tribes wouldn’t trade with each other.
	- Kumandra would’ve fallen. But you still have to keep your guard up.”
- Boun: Is that why you have those glowing weapons?
	- Raya defensively hides her satchel.
	- Sisu stares through Raya.
	- Raya analytically confesses. “I am not from Tail. Yes, I am collecting glowing weapons from each tribe. I have an important mission to make things right, for everyone. I’m sorry I’m not telling the whole story, but this is the truth.”
	- “Okay.” “Okay?”
	- “Yeah. I didn’t tell you about my parents, either. Like it or not, I guess I have to trust you just enough to win together. Like the people of Talon.”
- “Gus-gus. Stay safe, Boun.”
	- “Take care, Raya, Sisu!”
 %%

#### Hello, Talon

- Raya heel-turns, but grabs onto Sisu (for fear of water)
- She monologues: Our schedule is three days late because the boat got damaged. Tuk-Tuk is swimming nearby. I’ve got my whistle to call him when we need to escape. Now Sisu, you—
- Sisu’s exasperated: Boun already knows. Let him in!
	- Raya: He’s… too young.
	- Sisu: We need to travel by boat if you want to avoid the Druun and be faster than Namaari.
	- Raya: Fine. We’ll get another sailor. Boun knows too much.
- Raya: we need to get new clothes to blend in. Follow close.

> **EXT. MARKET STREET, TALON - NIGHT**

- Raya leads Sisu down a street
	- crowds jostle, vendors haggle prices
	- the oddly-dressed pair are singled out by the vendors, hard to move
	- vendors:
		- Aha! This headscarf goes beautifully with your traditional Tail wear!
		- first purchase, half price!
		- hello ladies, I’m from Tail too! Let me show you around!
	- Sisu: Wow, everyone’s so friendly!
		- Sisu gets caught by a lotion salesperson lol
		- With free lotion, Sisu’s obligated to purchase

> **EXT. ALLEY, TALON - NIGHT**

- Raya pulls Sisu around into an alley
	- Raya comforts herself: Soon, we’ll be at Spine. On solid ground. With saner people.
- Raya prostrates herself on the boardwalk and reaches under. She retrieves a bundled package.
	- Raya: I’ve prepared this last time I was here. There’s local clothes and supplies.
	- The pair put on the local clothing outerwear (Raya backpacks the rest)
- Sisu picks up a note attached to the package.
	- Sisu: Hey, what’s this? “Guard up. Fang spy in Talon. Arrived few days ago.” You wrote this to yourself?
- 

#### The Plan

…

%%
- Khaang or Noi attempts to steal the bag? plays it off as a petty thief?
	- Khaang already recommended by Nan. Noi suss’ed for going straight for the bag
	- Noi takes the bag because:
		- Noi says she’s secretly Talon princess
			- she knows Raya is here for the gems?
			- she knows Raya from before?
		- but she really knows about Raya because Nan set her up to impress Raya
			- to get an extra cut of the coin reward from Raya?
		- Raya needs more backup — she needs “Noi”
 %%

- Sisu: You have a friend?!
- Raya: I have an accomplice.
- Raya: Sisu, this is Nan.
- masks

%%
- Sisu: Okay. My dragon-senses are telling me the… thing we want… is that way.
	- Raya: That’s the Talon Palace, just as I guessed. It’s heavily guarded.
- Sisu: Okay, so I was thinking you let me go first.
	- Huh?
	- With the Talon Chief. Hang Dai?
	- “Dang Hai. And no, you can’t come”
	- I’ve been asleep for 500 years, the Druun monsters are back, and I’m the only dragon who isn’t stone.
	- if he finds out you’re really Sisu, then he’ll imprison you and use you. Easier: I’ll just dip in, get the gem, and get out.”
	- We don’t need to steal, we can work together.
	- Things are different now, Sisu. The chiefs may have worked together 500 years ago, but nowadays, every chief just works for their own tribe.
 %%

### E2 – Need

#### Meet Noi, Nan and Ner

- three Talon locals
	- we find out later that one of them is definitely a Fang spy
	- all three are frauds in some way, though
	- who’s the spy?
- Noi pretends to be the chieftan’s daughter
	- only during Mask Festival can Noi go around anonymously
	- Noi helps to get Raya to the palace
	- “Dang Hai only has sons…”

#### Getting to Dang Hai

#### Disaster

- Midpoint: realising there’s a Fang spy
	- only one of the gang knew about the plan

##### Namaari in Heart

#### False Victory with The Gem

- reveal Nan is Noi’s parent figure

#### The Trap

#### Sacrifice

- one of them sells Raya out to the local Talon authorities
- Raya looks back; there isn’t much time.
	- “My real name is Raya, daughter of Chief Benja of the tribe of Heart. The land of Kumandra fell apart because I made a mistake. Sisudatu is the Last Dragon. If you re-assemble the Gem, she will revive everyone who was turned to stone. Don’t trust anyone. Or do. I don’t know, I just know that I trust you. I have to.”
	- She throws over the satchel containing the Gem weapons.
	- She looks away. “I’m sorry bá, I couldn’t do it.”
- Noi takes Raya’s place
	- “Noi, she’s just another liar!”
	- “No! For the first time in my life, I’m hearing the truth.”
	- Noi exchanges places with Raya: she gets petrified.

#### Resolution

- The Steamboat sails off
- Raya files through the satchel
	- She double-takes. Ruffles it again. Turns its contents out.
	- The Kujang. The Karambit.
	- Heart’s Whip-Keris is missing.
- Raya freaks out. Wails. Angry.
