# RAYA E4 - Talon

> **Episode 4: Kumandra’s Notoriety**

Theme: Kumandra’s repeat interactions

> **🚧 WIP**, come talk to me IRL for more heh

## Ideas

- repeat interactions—**REPUTATION**
- switcheroo fake artefacts, how to trust the real one?
- Boun and Sisu on the hunt for a ship component fix part, that broke by the Druun because Raya doubted Boun was going offshore to memoralize parents
- dragon-fruit
- remember to remind Raya’s spasm PTSD once
- Heart refugees undercover in Talon
	- Raya is excited to meet her own people, trusting them!
	- but they betray her — you can’t even trust your own
	- foreshadowing Raya’s betrayal?
- masks, costumes, disguises
	- oh there’s a Mask Festival?
		- the real dragons/help are the friends we make along the way! (?)
	- a chase scene where everyone looks the same
	- Sisu doesn’t want/need to wear a mask
		- would be cool if she turns into a dragon, people think she’s a costume
		- people are just so numb with lies that they don’t know the truth
- Every trust can be broken for a price
	- Raya bargains to buy off Talon’s Gem shard by betrayal
- “Everyone’s a fake, anyways. A dishonest man, you can trust to be dishonest.”
	- A greedy man, you can trust to win as the highest bidder
- Namaari’s scout as an active agent
	- the scout steals Raya’s whip-sword artefact and returns to Namaari
	- Raya is more angry at Namaari — it’s her last attachment to her father, as well as a Gem shard
	- Naamari actually hadn’t commanded it. She sighs and makes plans to make use of it. She’s still upset with her scout, and decommissions him. Her true motives are still murky.
	- now the gang ends the story down with one gem shard in the hands of the enemy.
	- they will encounter Namaari in Spine.
- two Talon locals: one child, one cynical parent figure
- Raya’s stuck — she sacrifices(?) herself, resigns to die (water? Druun?)
	- she tells Boun and Talons: follow Sisu. She trusts them with the artefacts (she’s been stingy with them all this while). It’s really her last moment. She echoes her father’s One Kumandra.
	- The parent figure believes Raya.The parent figure switches places, so that the parent figure gets turned to stone, trusting that Raya will really turn all the stone people back.
		- maybe the parent figure lost someone to stone
	- the Talon kid now joins them on their journey, having to revive parent figure
	- maybe it’s the kid who believes and self-sacrifices
	- maybe the Fang scout imposter is here too, still taking an artefact for themselves
- Namaari subplot
	- early scene showing dispatching of scout?
	- talk with one of her party, an older guy who remembers before the Scattering
	- they have to shortcut through Heart to get to Fang early
		- Namaari’s also PTSD’d at Heart
		- maybe she got the mentor’s brother petrified at Heart
		- they don’t know the full truth? Virana pushed the false narrative that Raya shot first after leading Namaari into a trap?
	- They get to Fang by the end of the episode — they need to be in Spine by the next
- Sisu gets captured
- Raya says she doesn’t trust friends
	- but Raya actually has one Talon contact/confidante from long ago
	- that person had been assembling a team
- fourth guy who trains the Ongi monkeys
	- but after the failure, the monkey trainer gets petrified — the monkeys follow the gang
	- maybe he spends more time with Sisu, since he’s not a major suspect
- rivers drying
	- older buildings are higher up above the water, where the water level used to be — the “center” is higher up
	- newer buildings, at the fringes, especially docks, are lower
- needing a team
	- Raya has no reputation, can’t get anywhere
	- she needs a group of people to vouch for her
	- these people who have built up reputation and trustworthiness, only to break it for Raya
	- they are inherently betray trust in order to work in the team
		- they have all the reasons to double-triple-cross
- thematic stances
	- **simplified reputation**
		- one-strike collab—Boun, Sisu
		- one-strike betray—Raya
	- don’t play the reputation game—they really lose out (**avoidant reputation**)
	- collab for reputation
		- just to betray for the highest bidder (**fleeting reputation**)
		- some really try to gain reputation
			- but the ones who are very popular and people vouch for, are the ones who have betrayed to get those popular votes
			- yeah so **false reputation**
				- the recruiter has **fake reputation**—he has vouchers, but substance is fake
		- **inconclusive reputation**—perverted positive, waiting good but too long
- setting
	- reputation is everything.
	- you can’t use previous strategy of “always betray” because your reputation shows
- Talon locals all have long fingernails (on one or more fingers)
	- lol 2024-11-19 IRL saw my cab driver had this, and made a connection
	- like some Asians like to keep one finger’s fingernail super long
	- SUPER in theme with “Talon” the name
	- This is why Raya needs to work in a team—she has much shorter fingernails, she can’t grow it overnight
	- the Fang spy has long fingernails
		- fake nails? (hmm maybe Raya tries this at the start, only to be found out?)
		- real nails, built up just for this

## Snowflake Method

- Raya must work with a team to obtain Talon’s Gem shard (to save the world)
- Raya enters Talon, ready to semi-trust trustworthy allies. She assembles a necessary team to obtain the Gem shard. She gets pressed by an unknown Fang Spy, besides her own teammates. She must decide whether to sellout her sucky team, or keep her own promises.
- Character Profiles
	- Raya’s goal is to get Talon’s Gem shard from the princess. However, she has a one-strike reputation. She needs to learn how to rightly evaluate the overtime reputation of others—and how to build her own.
- Quarters
	- Q1: Raya attempts Goal #1 of her heist, but fails for insufficient reputation/group-work. In the fallout of her failure, she reluctantly works with a team.
	- Q2: During the Ghost Mask Festival, the gang kidnap the wandering Talon princess. A present Fang spy and Raya’s mega-heist is revealed, disrupts the plan. But with collaboration, they achieve another Goal #1.
	- Q3: The gang solidifies, trading secrets in trust. This makes them more effective. Suddenly, the whip-sword is stolen. Raya interrogates the group and they fall apart. Raya does something huge. Sisu is captured by the traitor. The Fang spy plans to release Druun onto the Talon floating city (epic. but why?).
	- Q4: Raya, alone, goes to save Sisu. Sisu is freed to push back the Druun. But too weak alone, Raya is captured to be petrified—she makes her final speech. It rouses the one of the pair to sacrifice themselves. The other person escapes with Raya, Sisu and Boun.

		- Think: Boun spilled the beans?
- E5: (claim the prize):
	- Talon on lockdown
	- Tuk-Tuk comes out,
	- missing Sisu? Noi?
- E6: (pay the price):
	- start with:
		- whip-sword stolen. → sets up the desperation of Raya’s sacrifice

## Workspace

### E1 - Comfort

#### Namaari/Khaan Hook

> **EXT. MOUNTAINTOP - DUSK**

- Namaari and her squad are surveying from a lookout point, making camp
- A glow appears, just on the horizon, along a river
	- Junior Soldier: “Khaan could’ve arrived sooner at Talon.”
	- her Serlot roars a yawn.
	- Namaari, “Then Raya will know Khaan is a Fang scout, barging in on a large noisy Serlot.”
- Namaari turns back to an older, decorated soldier
	- “General Thaam, can’t we find another route back home to Fang?”
	- “Princess, if you want to arrive home in five days, without meeting any Druun, then we need to go through Heart.”
	- Namaari’s reluctant.
	- “I know how much that night hurt you, fifteen years go. I was there, too. But if Raya is out to steal the Gem shards from every tribe, then your mother needs to make plans.”
	- (What? Namaari, hurt? Wasn’t she the one who backstabbed Raya?) #payme
- “Okay, General. Let’s hope Khaan succeeds in…”

#### Goodbye Boun

> **EXT. TALON - NIGHT**

- Chyron: **TALON**
	- (about five days after E1, but it’s not explicit to audience)
- some establishing shots: the floating platforms, the merchant boats, lanterns, noisy crowds

> **EXT. DOCKS, TALON - NIGHT**

- The battle-torn Steamboat pulls into Talon docks. The gang steps out and takes a walk.
- Sisu ogles: I didn’t know Talon became so… beautiful…
	- Boun picks a perfect lychee out of an overflowing crate
	- Boun: If only the families in Tail could’ve banded together like this…
	- Raya snatches it: Yeah, a band of scammers and frauds. That’s fake.
	- Raya discreetly tosses the lychee into the water. Fish snap over each other to win it. One fish slurps it, but on biting down on it—its life and colour drains to grey. It floats up, dead.
- Boun: “Then why do people still trade with them?”
	- Raya: “Because like it or not. Without Talon, the tribes wouldn’t trade with each other at all. Kumandra would’ve really fallen.
	- Just keep your guard up. Be careful who you buy from.”
- Raya: Reminds me, the payment for the past week of delicacies on the Steamboat… and for saving my life. (gesturing to her wound that Boun bandaged)
	- Boun’s eyes widen as a bunch of coins drop into his hand
	- Raya: Double of what I promised. I’m sorry I assumed the worst of you. Purchase your ship repairs and go crazy with cooking ingredients!
- “Thank you, Raya! And good luck with stealing Talon’s Gem artefact.”
	- Raya double-takes, sternly: “What?! Shhhh! How—? Never mind. If people find out, they’ll—don’t you tell ANYONE about this.”
		- #payme later, the whole of Talon finds out. Raya blames Boun, but it’s the spy.
	- “But… can’t _I_ know about it?”
	- “No.”
	- “…okay. I didn’t tell you about what happened to my family, either.”
	- “In the end, we both still got what we wanted!”
	- Boun sadly nods, shrugs, poking at his disfigured ship. “I’m going to find ship repair parts now. Raya, I trust that you’re a good guy… but I’ll never know for sure.” They part ways.

%%
- Boun reaches out his hand at the first stall for a fruit.
	- Raya catches his hand and leads him away. She whispers, “That’s fake.”
	- Sisu: “Fake?” They regroup away and look around at the stalls.
	- Raya: “They’re almost all fake. They’re banded together alright, a band of scammers and frauds.”
	- “Then why do people still trade with them?”
	- “Because like it or not. Without Talon, the tribes wouldn’t trade with each other.
	- Kumandra would’ve fallen. But you still have to keep your guard up.”
- Boun: Is that why you have those glowing weapons?
	- Raya defensively hides her satchel.
	- Sisu stares through Raya.
	- Raya analytically confesses. “Yes, I am not from Tail. Yes, I am collecting glowing weapons from each tribe. I have an important mission to make things right, for everyone. I’m sorry I’m not telling the whole story, but this is the truth.”
	- “Okay.” “Okay?”
	- “Yeah. I didn’t tell you about my parents, either. Like it or not, I guess I have to trust you just enough to win together. Like the people of Talon.”
- “Gus-gus. Stay safe, Boun.”
	- “Take care, Raya, Sisu!”
 %%

#### Hello, Talon

- Raya heel-turns, but grabs onto Sisu (for fear of water)
- Raya monologues: Our schedule is three days late because the boat got damaged. Tuk-Tuk is swimming nearby. I’ve got my whistle to call him when we need to escape. Now Sisu, you—
- Sisu’s exasperated: “Boun already knows. Let him in!”
	- Raya: He’s… too young.
	- Sisu: We need to travel by boat if you want to avoid the Druun AND be faster than Namaari.
	- Raya: Fine. We’ll find another sailor. Boun knows too much.
- Raya: we need to get new clothes to blend in. Follow close.

> **EXT. MARKET STREET, TALON - NIGHT**

- Raya leads Sisu down a street
	- crowds jostle, vendors haggle prices
	- the oddly-dressed pair are singled out by the vendors, hard to move
	- vendors:
		- “Aha! This headscarf goes beautifully with your traditional Tail wear!”
		- “first purchase, half price!”
		- “hello ladies, I’m from Tail too! Let me show you around!”
	- Sisu: Wow, everyone’s so friendly!
		- Sisu gets caught by a lotion salesperson lol—Raya, Raya, give me money to buy this lotion

> **EXT. ALLEY, TALON - NIGHT**

- Raya pulls Sisu around into an alley
	- Raya comforts herself: Soon, we’ll be at Spine. On solid ground. With saner people.
- Raya prostrates herself on the boardwalk and reaches under. She retrieves a bundled package.
	- Raya: I’ve prepared this last time I was here. There’s local clothes and supplies.
	- The pair put on the local clothing outerwear (Raya backpacks the rest)
- Sisu picks up a note attached to the package.
	- Sisu: Hey, what’s this? “Guard up. Fang spy in Talon. Arrived few days ago.” You wrote this to yourself?
- (they kena attacc)

#### The Plan

…

%%
- Khaan or Noi attempts to steal the bag? plays it off as a petty thief?
	- Khaan already recommended by Nan. Noi suss’ed for going straight for the bag
	- Noi takes the bag because:
		- Noi says she’s secretly Talon princess
			- she knows Raya is here for the gems?
			- she knows Raya from before?
		- but she really knows about Raya because Nan set her up to impress Raya
			- to get an extra cut of the coin reward from Raya?
		- Raya needs more backup — she needs “Noi”
 %%

- Sisu: You have a friend?!
- Raya: I have an accomplice.
- Raya: Sisu, this is Nan.
- masks

%%
- Sisu: Okay. My dragon-senses are telling me the… thing we want… is that way.
	- Raya: That’s the Talon Palace, just as I guessed. It’s heavily guarded.
- Sisu: Okay, so I was thinking you let me go first.
	- Huh?
	- With the Talon Chief. Hang Dai?
	- “Dang Hai. And no, you can’t come”
	- I’ve been asleep for 500 years, the Druun monsters are back, and I’m the only dragon who isn’t stone.
	- if he finds out you’re really Sisu, then he’ll imprison you and use you. Easier: I’ll just dip in, get the gem, and get out.”
	- We don’t need to steal, we can work together.
	- Things are different now, Sisu. The chiefs may have worked together 500 years ago, but nowadays, every chief just works for their own tribe.
 %%

### E2 – Need

#### Meet Noi, Nan and Ner

- three Talon locals
	- we find out later that one of them is definitely a Fang spy
	- all three are frauds in some way, though
	- who’s the spy?
- Noi pretends to be the chieftan’s daughter
	- only during Mask Festival can Noi go around anonymously
	- Noi helps to get Raya to the palace
	- “Dang Hai only has sons…”

#### Getting to Dang Hai

#### Disaster

- Midpoint: realising there’s a Fang spy
	- only one of the gang knew about the plan

##### Namaari in Heart

#### False Victory with The Gem

- reveal Nan is Noi’s parent figure

#### The Trap

#### Sacrifice

- one of them sells Raya out to the local Talon authorities
- Raya looks back; there isn’t much time. The Druun approach.
	- “My real name is Raya, daughter of Chief Benja of the tribe of Heart. The land of Kumandra fell apart because I made a mistake. Sisudatu is the Last Dragon. If you re-assemble the Gem shards from each tribe, she will revive everyone who was turned to stone. Don’t trust anyone. Or do. I don’t know, I just know that I trust you. I have to.”
	- (that’s a banger voiceover snippet for a trailer)
	- She throws over the satchel containing the Gem weapons.
	- She looks away. “I’m sorry bá, I couldn’t do it.”
- Noi takes Raya’s place
	- “Noi, she’s just another liar!”
	- “No! For the first time in my life, I’m hearing the truth.”
	- Noi exchanges places with Raya: she gets petrified.

#### Resolution

- The Steamboat sails off
- Raya files through the satchel
	- She double-takes. Ruffles it again. Turns its contents out.
	- The Kujang. The Karambit.
	- Heart’s Whip-Keris is missing.
- Raya freaks out. Wails. Angry.
