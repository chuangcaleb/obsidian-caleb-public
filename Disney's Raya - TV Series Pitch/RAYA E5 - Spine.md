# RAYA E5 - Spine

## Ideas

- "The gem isn't a weapon!" Well now it really is made into weapons, and actually helps against Druun.
- Spine does need their super-staff to survive, and are willing to give it up on Sisu's authenticity
- [Jianzi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jianzi) / đá cầu / sipa / capteh
	- except it's like combat juggling
	- each team has to keep "alive" their dacau, whilst trying to take down the other teams'
	- maybe they have three each, and can use them to hit others out of the air
		- the lighter women are launched into the air to spike opponents' balls out
	- soft combat is allowed!
	- there's a 2m deep pond in the center of the arena
		- Spine players abuse Raya not willing to cross into the pond
		- Raya must admit her fear of water,
			- or maybe be willing to stand underwater to boost her shorter teammates like Noi to land a spike
	- Namaari brings chilis from Fang to help with the cold
- lol one of those doors with an eye slider, where you have to answer a prompt with the correct passphrase
- they don't believe in dragons lol
- Raya's the avatar of the worst traits of the five nations lol
	- Old Kumandra
		- copycat
		- at first, they were all nice, and reciprocal
		- then when Namaari started cheating,
		- Raya (and Kumandra) copycats, always being untrusting from now on
	- Tail: generally untrusting
		- doubt enemies
		-  always cheat?
	- Talon: false deception
		- doubt friends
		- coop once – then cheat
		- repeat interactions
	- Spine: indifferent independence
		- doubt everyone (after once?)
		- grudger
		- will take handouts but won’t give
		- forever stuck in non-cooperation
		- needs to learn the non-zero sum game — if you don’t help others, they can’t help you, and you need help
	- Heart: champion conspiring
		- trust everyone?
		- always cooperate?
	- Fang: ruthless, internal trust
		- always cheat?—nah it gotta be more complex than that at this final stage
- they find a water redirection
	- Raya takes twice as long to find all river ends, because of all the redirection
