# Colophon

## Source Code

Public source code for this website is available at [chuangcaleb/chuangcaleb.com: My Personal Website (v2). Focus on streamlining DX & using CSS Variables for component variants](https://github.com/chuangcaleb/chuangcaleb.com).

## Fonts

This site uses the beautiful [Alegreya](https://www.huertatipografica.com/en/fonts/alegreya-ht-pro) + [Alegreya Sans](https://www.huertatipografica.com/en/fonts/alegreya-sans-ht) fonts by [Huerta Tipográfica – Type foundry](https://www.huertatipografica.com/en), under the [SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007](https://github.com/huertatipografica/Alegreya/blob/master/LICENSE.md) as accessed on 28th July 2024.

## Privacy

The website is served on [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). I’ve enabled [Cloudflare Web Analytics](https://www.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/).

> Cloudflare Web Analytics does not use any client-side state, such as cookies or localStorage, to collect usage metrics. We also don’t “fingerprint” individuals via their IP address, User Agent string, or any other data for the purpose of displaying analytics.

I’m just curious what pages on this site get visited, and what country viewers come from. You can use any reliable ad-block, and you’ll see the request for`https://static.cloudflareinsights.com/beacon.min.js` be blocked.

Yeah besides that, there’s nothing else. There’s really nothing to track. This is a personal fun project, handcrafted code from scratch, with dependencies being public open-source.

I don’t embed `iframes`, except for some Youtube `iframes`, I’m yet to enhance this.
