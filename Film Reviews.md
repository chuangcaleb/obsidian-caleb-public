# Film Reviews

I like yapping about films to my friends. Sometimes, I write my yappings down.

## Format

I try to do a format where I list out (a) stuff I liked and (b) stuff I’d tweak. It’s a practice where I try to dissect (a) what worked well and (b) how to maximise missed opportunities (with minimum effort).

Usually the first 1-2 tweaks go really crazy (imo), and then the later ones may go into nitpicking territory. The few tweaks are always why I decide to start writing on a specific show in the first place. Often it’s as simple as flipping a single detail on its head.

📚 Books take years to write and seconds to burn. So easy to criticise. So I don’t publish my tweaks until I’ve evaluated and spotlighted the good aspects, too.

## On tweaks

These aren’t 😡-criticisms, but are 🏋️-exercises. A simulation with the gift of foresight, with no deadlines, no execs and an ideal environment. And I do care for these stories — people don’t write so much for what they don’t care about, haha!

I’ve personally experienced how a production is complicated by conflicting forces from higher-up executives with different agendas, teammates with different inspirations, and sudden disasters. Sometimes for the better, often for the worse.

These are written by professionals over years. No way I can scramble up something better than them. But—I can learn from them. Come join me!
